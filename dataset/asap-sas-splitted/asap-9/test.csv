The section titles 'What IS Space Junk?' explains that space junk is the debris in spacve that are orbitting Earth, such as broken space capsules, telescopes and satellites. The section called 'Crash Course' explains that sometimes these objects crash into eachother. Because these objects can be traveling at speeds of more than 20,000 miles per hour they break into hundreds of pieces that each assume their own orbitual path. The last section called 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' describes how big of a problem space junk is.

The author starts by grabbing your attention saying to look at the sky and see a tool bag (paragraphs 1 and 2). The author then starts to explain the history of space junk and how 'the human race's great space invasion' started it all (paragraph 4). Next, the different things that become space junk are explained by stating how 'the disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit (paragraph 5). The author also shows the dangers of space junk by saying that 'bits of space debris present a very serious problem' because 'tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the the most carefully designed spacecraft' (paragraph 9).

The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?' goes into detail about what 'space junk' is and how all that waste come to settle into our orbit in the first place. The next section, 'Crash Course,' explains the dangers of dead satellites in the atmosphere and how they are at risk for collisions.The last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' relates back all the information about 'space junk' back to the reader, explaining it's signifigance and why the reader should care.",2
25075,9,"The author starts out with an exciting yet almost comical opener. It wasn't something i expected, but obviously something i needed to know, since it is currently a concern to government space agencies.     The second paragraph begins by giving us some background on what exactly this space junk is. It tells us that there are objects positioned hundreds of miles above Earth and some of them circle the planet indefinitely. Now, once this piece of high-teck space object 'dies' it become one more piece of junk added to space, which makes a problem because now its circling the globe in an uncontrolled manner.     Then it leads us into the crash course section explaining the now dead satellites have the risk of crashing into one another. The effect of that happening now causes the problem of tiny little pieces of debris floating around all throughout space. But those pieces are not the only debris that roams the atmosphere, any object that are released into space become free-orbiting satellites. So are astronauts have to be very cautions while in space to be sure nothing is left out in the open.     The last topic the author touches on is how little things propose a bigger problem. Those little pieces are flying around at five miles per second! That is pretty dangerous because when we send our spacemen up there, if one of those were to hit the shuttle, it could easily go strait through it, or damage it to a certain degree that would only make their journey more difficult. Never fear though, scientist have worked hard on a solution as to how they will keep track of all the debris, and they ended up just giving them different code names, and keeping a radar on them at all times, that way they know the safety zones for whats good, and whats bad.",2
25076,9,"It's basically like a debate, and this was his side of things. He got the information used to show that it is a problem, out there or Earth too, like it said, if it got into our atmosphere, it could seriously do some damage, falling materials all over could wipe out millions of people.      It's also not healthy for the enviroment of Earth and Space either. The earth could have some more junk all over, and if there is junk in pace then it could come really polluted up there, who knows how much of our things is hurting everyone.",1

Then he calls it junk because sometimes the stuff they lost or put in space becomes very dangerous to the planet but no one knows. The reason why because if you tell people the truth they wouldnt know how to handle it or how to act when you tell them. Some people over exzagerate the problem and cause all kinds of confusion. Space is a dangerous place to enter and play around with. There is no gravity or oxygen to provide, unless your on a spaceship. Most times space ships are not even safe. Some people can not handle moving slow or seeing things they have never seen before.   He was telling about the spaceship that was first launched in 1957 by the Soviet Union but it was artificial and the the United States followed suit. Whicha began the human race's great space invation. Thing like that causes confusion to everyone who can not ake it. He also was giving information about the variety of spacecrafts their was and about the global communicaton an how they launch spaceships. He kept it plan an simple and to the point how distrutive people are to their world and even to outerspace that is most dangerous to the earth.   In conclusion, the fact that the matter is.
