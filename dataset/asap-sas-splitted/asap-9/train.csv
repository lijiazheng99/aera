23101,9,1,2,The flow of the article is wonderful.  First it tackles the question of what space junk is and how it is caused.  Then the author talks about a couple of examples that have caused space junk.  The last thing the author talks about is the debris that is caused by space junk colliding.
23102,9,1,1,"The author of 'Orbiting Junk' grabs your attention but shouting out statements, it makes you wonder what the author is talking about. Putting the article in to segment is a sure why to have your reader know what you're talking about. The author puts his article into four different segments.

He talks about global wirelees stuff and how the things he does works for him. and how he loves what he does. when talking about the aritcle the guy talks about how people rsearch stuff and read about stuff and get the wrong idea about how science is prtraid.  it think it has a lot to do with the guys opinon about how people look at the science portion of this article.       for the guy who was writing this article he has a huge disatvantage when it comes to explaining things in this aritcle, when people don't understand the things your talking about it makes everything that much harder to talk about.      if you have peoples attention make sure they know what your talking about or atleast know the subject of the things your talking about."

The next passage after that becomes a little more serious to make the reader understand how harmful space junk can be.      Then in the next section, the author gives the reader background information on space junk. That is important to people can understand what space junk is and how space equipment becomes space junk. That section connects well the Crash Couse section, which tells the reader some specific information about crashes in space.     The final section explains in an elaborate way how harmful space junk can be and what cause it can have in the future. So overall, the author goes from grabbing the readers attention,  to giving background information for understanding, to specific details and events, and then finally the effects and future effects space junk can have."
23120,9,2,2,"The article is organized by the author into sections. Each section is seperate different subjects. For example, the section titled 'Crash Course' is explaining that when things break apart the debri stays in space and it can cause damage to other things simpily by just hitting it."

23226,9,1,0,The author uses a good inroductory statement with a good thesis.The author uses some background history of space exploration. The paragraphs that folllows desribe what happens to spacecraft and other objects that go up to space. The author uses a good conclusion.
23227,9,2,2,The Author organizes this article into sections/questions for each topic.  The Author is letting us know which information about space junk should go where and where we can find it. It is a very helpful way in letting us find information on a given idea. He gives us a background of space junk and then gives us sipporting details of why this is a big deal.
23228,9,1,2,"The author organizes the article in sections such as 'What Is Space Junk,' 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'"

23232,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by using interesting facts to grab the reader's attention. In the paragraph 'What Is Space Junk' the author defines what is causing the problem in space. In 'Crash Course' the author says how the debris is created. Finally in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author talks about the dangers of the debris in space and how various space programs are dealign with it."
23233,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by dividing the entire article into certain sections. Some of the sections included: 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' In 'What Is Space Junk', it described what space junk actually is. Its says that some of the disabled objects become a piece of high-tech junk, and it cirlces the globe in uncontrolled orbit. In the next section, 'Crash Course', it talks about a time when two communications satellites crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth. In the last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', it talks about how tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. It also states that the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commerical space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration."
23236,9,2,2,He starts out with a very attention getting thesis and the he starts at the beging to explain the space junk and what it is.Then he tells you what the junk came from and how it got there. At the end he tells you jow it can harm you or the earth and how dangerous it can be.
23239,9,1,1,talks about how Soviet Union lantched the first satellite and the United States folowed suit and this started the space Junk. how the rockets fall back to earth. and how some of the satellites still orbit the earth and how some have crashed back into the earth.

23242,9,0,0,i think he is trying to tell us that there is space junk up there and we need to cut back on it cause it can be dificault to manuver a spacecraft throught it when they are lanching off the platform.
23243,9,2,2,This person organizes it by having head lines in bold letters. This person also starts out by asking a question and then going into what is Space junk. Then it slowly goes into crash courses and how bad it effects our atmosphere.
23245,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by identifying what exactly it is we are talking about, then by saying where it comes from, finally the author ends with how it does this. In 'What Is Space Junk', the author tells us what space junk is. Space junk is pieces of debris from various space crafts and such. In 'Crash Course', the author states that these debris come from dead satellites that run into each other. Finally, in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', The auther explains how these debris can be very dangerous. These debris when traveling at five miles per second can cause serious damage to elite spacecrafts."
23246,9,0,0,He gose in order one what he knows. Instead of skiping around.
23247,9,0,0,CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
23248,9,1,1,This article is organize mostly like an outline. It has different sections and after each few parphgraphs it has a new title telling what the paprphraps will be about.
23249,9,1,1,He organizes it by starting from when spacecrafts were first being launched and the problems they were causing then to the ones being launched today and the problems they're causing now.
23250,9,2,2,The first three paragraphs get you hooked into the story and make you want to read more.  Paragraphs four and five give you information about the history of space travel and how and why the space juck is even in space.  Paragraphs six and seven tell you how dangerous space junk really is.  The last four paragraphs let the reader know who is worried about space junk and what people are doing to fix the problem of space junk.
23251,9,2,2,"The author begins the article with a catchy indtroduction. Then, the author gets more serious, and begins to describe space history and the occurence of 'space junk' in outer space. The author states his/her claim that 'space junk' is a danger, and supports this claim with facts regarding the speed and amount of 'space junk' in space. The author's claim is concluded by stating that several space agencies are working to take care of this problem."
23252,9,2,2,The author organizes the article by starting with an attention getter. Than the author gives his thesis statment. The author goes on to give background information about the space program.  Than the aithor stresses the dangers of small free floating particles in space.  The author wraps up the article by giving future problems that could occur
23253,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article really well in my opinion. The author starts off with an interesting introduction that slowly brings you into the rest of the article.     After that they get into a sub topic clearloy explaining exactly what is space junk and how it has developed in our orbits. They used many facts that really impact the readers knowledge about this space junk.     Next they talk about how the debris free-orbiting the eart can cause collisions with other debris. They use facts and even an instance where the colliosions have appeared.     In the final topic they speak about the dangerous and the threats that the debris can cause. This passage is very well made with facts, comparisons and even an instance of adding more dangerous space junk by loosing a tool bag."
23254,9,2,1,"The author starts by telling a simple story about a tool bad falling from the sky. Then the author defines space junk and it's threat to Earth. The it gives some information about two satellites crashing. Last but not least, the author tells us the big pictures. Such as how the debris can harm spacecrafts and imcreasing amount of space junk."
23258,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by putting them into different sections on space exploration. The author puts 'What is Space Junk?' first for explaining the variety of things we are putting in the atmosphere. The puts 'Crash Course' this is letting us know that the space junk is now orbitting around the earth at intense speeds. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' this is explaing the danger in these objects orbitting the Earth."
23260,9,1,1,The author organizes the article with different topics realting to 'space junk.' The author uses seperation by organizing the article with different sub-topics that explain in more detail the dangers in space junk.
23261,9,2,2,The author organized the article in a unique way. Firts starting with an introduction that came with excitment. then explaining what he was going to talk about 'space junk'. Then with what happens with all this junk and if it carshes. After that how little bits can make a big deal later on. Finally ending with a conclusion.
23262,9,2,2,"In the first section the auther explains what space junk is and how it got into space. In the second section the author tells about how free-orbiting satellites can crash into each other, causing small satellites to be formed. In the last section of paragraphs the author talks about how big of a danger small free-orbiting satellites can pose and how many countries are trying to find a soloution to the problem."
23263,9,1,1,"The author organizes this article in a way that first presents the problem, then the author goes into further depth about the issue. The author first explains where space debris comes from then explains why it is so dangerous. The author begins with a fact, 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.' This makes the reader understand first where the space debris comes from, then the author discusses the dangerous effects of space debris.'At extreme speeds, little bits can pack a punch powerful enough to create disastrous holes in an object moving through space.'"
23266,9,2,2,"The author in organized this article well by starting out with a common retorical allusion, explaining what space junk is, giving an example, and then explaining how it's a problem."
23267,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article into different sections each with a defined purpose. The first section is an attention grabber to get the reader interested. Line 1: 'Grab you telescope! look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' The second section is background to give the reader a little knowledge about the topic. Line 4: 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched th efirst artificial satellite. The United States followed suit, and thus began the human race's great space invasion.' The third section is what's going on now with the topic. Line 6: 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run th erisk o fcollding with each other. That's exactly what happened in February 2009.' The last section is why the reader should care about the topic. Line 8: 'So who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash?'"
23268,9,0,0,the auther wanted to write aboutthe danger of debris in space that culd destroy the satilites if not checked.
23269,9,0,0,Who organizes it over what things are important in space junk and the exploration of space junk.
23270,9,1,1,The author organized the article by splitting sections of paragraphs up using different chapter titles. This way the article can change topics somewhat freely without looking unprofessional. It also helps the author in knowing what to talk about where.
23271,9,1,2,"This article is organized by facts. Some are about junk,spacecrafts themselves,and even space trash. It is very well organized by the paragraphs."
23272,9,2,1,"The author organizes his thoughts very uniquely in this article.  For instance, they start out with a shocking statement for a lure.  Then they move on to a definition, and such requires the history of the objects.  After such they follow suite with the dangers of microdebris out in space and just how lethal it can become.  Upon the end of that they switch to how to counter-act the problem."
23273,9,1,1,He organizes it in different sections to seperate the different topics. He does this so that the reader doesn't get confused and it makes it more appealing to the reader.

23279,9,2,2,The author starts the artical by grabbing the reads attention with a good hook line. From the intro the author contunues onto define what space junk is to inform the reader what the rest of the paper is about. After defining what the space junk is the author then gives an examples of how space junk is made. After making sure the reader know what she is talking about the author goes into the subject of how dangorus these pieces of junk are to astronuts and space travelers. In the same paragraph the author also states the the scientifical community is serching for a solution to clean up the debries.
23280,9,1,2,"The author at the beginning, grabs your attention by saying shocking facts. Next, the author jumps right into factual information, such as: space junk. Then, the author discusses the harmful use of the present time. Lastly, the author talks about the future harms to come to space by talking about countries launching satelites into space, which will cause an extreme load of space junk."
23281,9,1,1,The author organizes the article into sections with headings. The headings give you an idea about what you will learn in the passage below the heading.
23282,9,1,1,The author divides it up into a few sections. Which I think is a pretty good idea because it grabbed my attention.
23283,9,0,1,"It gives specific detail about the space, and it tells you that scientist are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk. It's giving information about the satelite problems."
23284,9,0,0,"They organized the articles by telling what the problem was, then go over if these things stay in space how they could harm us."
23286,9,0,0,"At first the author grabs the readers attention, then the author organizes the article by making each article more important than the last."
23289,9,1,2,"The author organizes the article by first talking about Orbiting Junk, then What is space junk, then Crash Course, then Little Bits, But a Big Deal.  It just talks about each one indavigally by its self."
23290,9,1,1,"The author explains what space junk is, then explains how it is harmful, and last explains how serious this is and that we should help."
23291,9,0,0,he organizes it in the years
23292,9,1,2,"The author catchs or attention by making a some what funny statement. Then the author tells us some history behind spae invasion, in this section they talk about what happens to the debris that comes close to the earth. In the next section they talk about crashes that have happened between satellites from different countries They tell us a little story about how an astronaut lost his tool belt in space. They explain to us how even something that little can cause a big problem."
23293,9,1,1,The author breaks it down in sections. Each section talks about diffrent parts of the topic.
23296,9,1,2,"First the author grabs the reader's attention so that they will keep reading. The author then explains what space junk is so that the reader will know what the article is talking about. The next thing that is talked about is examples of how space junk ended up flying through space, like when the astronaut lost his grip on a tool box. The last thing he tells the reader what problems the space junk is causing and how people like NASA are trying to solve the problems."
23297,9,1,2,The author starts off the article with a simple introduction that will grab the reader's attention because of the funny reference. The author slowly goes into the importance of the debris floating around in space. The next paragraph of the article starts to inform the reader just what is space junk to clear up any other myth about it.        The examples of stories and even facts about what exactly is orbiting our earth keeps the article's main purpose flowing. Their idea was to lead into the true facts that the amount of debris orbiting with the earth is a great amount. The last paragraph is meant to leave the reader thinking about what is actually going on in the space above us.
23298,9,1,1,He put new headngs on it.Every time he would stairt a new secshion.
23299,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article into multiple sections which each have their own topic to cover. The topic of space hazards is too general to cover in one section, so many sections are needed to describe all aspects of the idea the writer is hoping to get across."
23300,9,1,1,They organize by events that are in differnt sections and they use them in that order

23308,9,1,1,The way the author organizes the article is quite interesting. The author breaks this article into sections making it easyer to read and summerizing each section on the way.
23309,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article in sub-headdings. This way seperates information into an easy to understand way so it is easy to find certain pieces of information. Such as in the sub-headding of 'Crash Course', it talks about our satellites colliding with Russia."
23310,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article with several sub-sections, with a length of about one to two pargraphs. This simplifies the material in the article making it easier to read. Also, the sections themselves are about different subjects, but share common points and topics within that tie together as the story continues and creates understanding of the main issue, that being, space junk and it's danger."
23311,9,2,2,The author explains the problem in the introduction and first paragraph. He then goes into why the problem is dangerous to astronauts and space shuttles. In the final paragraphs he shows how some nations are limiting space junk while it is increasing because of the ammount of countries undertaking space exploration.
23312,9,0,0,The author organizes the story through chronological order by starting with the year 1957 and ending by talking about present time. By doing this he is explaining things that occurred in space during more than half a century.

To emphasize the seriousness of space junk, he relates facts about real crashes that have occured. Finishing his article with information about the damage space junk can cause, the author writes about the paths being taken in order to remedy the situation. He finishes with a final warning that space trash is on the rise and companies must collaborate to fix the problem."
23317,9,1,1,"The author organizes the artical by explaining what space junk is, and using statistics from research books, internet. The author also organizes the story by stating what will happen to space if we keep sending satalites to space and giving decriptions about outer space and NASA.

23323,9,1,1,She starts out by gathering your attention about a coment so your like mhmmm sounds like a good article so then she goes on about space junk in 1952 founded by thesoviet union. then it goes on about over time it closes.
23324,9,2,2,The author organizes the article by sectioning it off into groups so we can understand the material. The author starts off light-hearted and keeps getting more serious. 'What Is Space Junk?' helps us understand the overall idea and explains the material in the article. Then the sections following that get more in depth and portray the seriousness of orbiting junk.
23325,9,1,1,"The author organizes th article by first telling you what they are talking about.  Next they talk about what can happen to space junk.  Then finally, they talk about the problem they pose on the surface, and the astronauts in space."
23327,9,0,0,I dont know
23328,9,2,2,The author first talks about what is the Earths autmosphere can handle and what we may see out there.  They then go on to what space junk actually is and how we have been doing it for the past fifty two years.  The crash course talks about how the little bits of debris can cause such a disaster in space and on Earth. They end the article by describing how the bits of fragments can cause the Earth and satilites big problems.

23332,9,1,0,"They organize it by importance and in order of how it will affect us. For example: how they talk about what it is, then stating how it happens, and then what the 'Space Junk' actually is."
23333,9,1,1,"The way this statement is organized is very well because they start off by getting your attention. Next they start with some basic information that will help you understand what is coming up, then after they hit the hard facts that you should know about 'space junk' like how even the smallest things in space can affect a big space ship with this happening also that we could have satellites crashing into each other and the tiny parts flying into earth. So this article is very organized."
23335,9,2,1,The author organizes the article by making sections of the article to have the reader become interested by the title and have them continue to read. They will learn about the dangers of space junk and what can happen to it.
23336,9,0,0,"starts with the beginning of it all and then goes through it all tell what we know now. it says in the beginning of what is space junk 'in 1957,' and in the end it says 'in 2008'."
23337,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by starting at the history of space explorations. The author wants the reader to have a good background of how many different satellites have been put into space orbit. The author then describes in great detail what exactly space junk is and what is made up of. The author wants the reader to comprehend the amount of space junk in space. The author then describes why there is space junk. He tells about what is causing space junk and why. The author describes that large things going extremely fast in orbit can cause tiny micro pieces being sent into space. Then the author tells the reaeder why they should care about space junk. The author gives us different ways the space junk is harmful to space ships, astronaunts, and other satellites. Then he or she says what different space companys are doing about the space junk and how they are trying to prevent it."
23339,9,1,1,Instead of putting all the topics into one big article the author breaks it down into sections. This keeps the article more organized and makes it small articles put into a bigger article. All the topics are related to one another.

He also puts older facts before the more recent ones, like he says in paragraph 4 'in 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.' Then in the sixth patagrath he talks about something that happened in 2009."
23342,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article by first giving a brief introduction on space junk, then they give a little bit of background information on space junk. Next, the author gives examples of when space junk was actually harmful. Finally, they explain how it's harmful and how it could potentially be a bigger problem."
23343,9,2,2,"The way the author organizes this article is that he uses a very eye cathing thesis or opening statements. for example ' Grab your telescope! Look up at the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!'. Then he puts a subtitle on the next subjects he brings up to keep it very organized. Example: 'What is space junk?', 'Crash Course', And then the last subtitle is 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. Each Subtitle leads into one another very nicely, and does not get uyou confused."

23347,9,2,1,"The author uses a hook to get the reader interested.  Then they tell about what space junk actually is for people who don't know.  They also tell how that space junk is created.  Finally, in the section titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' they emphasize that even though most space junk is only tiny peices, it is a serious problem and can cause a lot of issues."
23348,9,1,1,He organized them according to how serious the issue is. They are all a big p-roblem but some more then others. Like the satellites are all going to crash eventually is a scary thing to think about. Space debris is not always small there are some debris out there that would blow up a bigger satellite. Plus the astronauts have to go up there and fix things that get broke by the debris.
23349,9,1,1,"The author organizes this article by first grabbing the readers attention and then explaining the history of space travel and space junk.  Through the sixth paragraph the author talks about why space junk is dangerous and how it effects us today.  The author also brings up the tool bag inncident.  Most people wouldn't think it was a big deal if a tool bag was let loose in space, but the author organized this article to explain why it is such a big deal after describing what space junk is and to warn everyone of the dangers of space junk."
23350,9,0,0,By telling how space junk is when its in space and factors about it to.
23351,9,2,2,"The author brakes down the article into sections.  The sections he broke them into is: What is Space Junk, Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal."
23352,9,2,2,"The author begins the article with an attention getting introduction, followed by historicle statistics. Finally including that satellites are in great risk of colliding with eachother, and emphasizing the great danger of such small particles in space."
23353,9,1,1,He has it very organized. It goes in sections on how he wants it to be written.
23354,9,1,1,They orginized it by throwing in history facts in the begging and then talking about the problems that occur in space with  theses satilites and then they talk about how we can prevent all of these things that happen.
23355,9,0,0,The author organizes the article  by telling u what something is and tells u how it got there.

23358,9,2,2,The first paragraph is a very good attention getter it makes it clear to grab your attention. Then it follows into telling the readers a breif history passage about spacecraft. It also later goes into telling the risks of satellites controlling eachother. Lastely it talks about how loosing space trash is serious matter.
23359,9,1,1,"The aurthor devided their artical into sections. The first is to catch the reader attention. The second, to tell us what they are talking about and give us a breif history. In the forth and fith section she made it clear how important it was to try and reduce the amount of space junk."
23361,9,2,2,"The author starts his article with an attention grabber and briefly mentions space junk. In the next article the author by giving a short history of space flight, like the how the soviet Union  launched the first satellite. Next he describes how these space projects have caused problems and what they are sugesting to do."

They end the article then explaining why the pieces of space jusnk, which are so small, actually make a difference."
23673,9,1,1,"The other organizes it by telling you what it is, then it tells you how they become uncontrolled orbits and can have risks of colliding with eachother.

It's a tool bag?'     Then goes into the begining about how the 'Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.  The United States followed suit, and thus began the human race's great space invasion.'

In the second section the auther discribes how the dibry comes about.  in the third section, it is discribed at to what usually happens to the debre whenit is in the free flow orbit. This continues to what the posibilities are to going out into space, and what the dangers are."

Then it tells you how satellites crash in space. Then how people need to learn about the junk that can damage the spacecraft in space while traveling.
23776,9,2,1,"The author first states the problem then he expalins what the problem is by breaking it down into three parts. Thats why he he has a section called What is space junk, crash course, and little bits, but a big deal."

Next, we move on to What Is Space Junk, which explains the history of space exploration. It also talks about the problems with this though, and how when a satellite 'dies' it just keeps going in space. That is how we get Space Junk. Next we have Crash Course, which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites. This is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem. Last, they have Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This part is the conclusion, and talks about all the problems space junk can cause. It gives us examples like in paragragh 10 about the lost tool bag. This is important because it gives us a idea of just how dangerous this is. So that is how the author organizes this well written article. It helps keep it organized and makes it easier as a reader to read."

The article begins by telling the audience what problem they are going to elaborate on, which is orbiting junk. Next, they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves. What is space junk? Well, after reading the second paragraph, we know what that is. After this, we are educated on risks of crashes and collisions with the junk that is orbiting in our solar system. Last of all, we read that no matter how small the object is, it can have a large impact on other objects in the atmosphere.      Because these smaller topics are separated from each other, the reader can maintain their attention while reading of the many different factors of space junk."
24066,9,1,1,"The author writes this article so that the term 'space junk' is explained in the beginning.  The process of the object becoming a space junk is explained in the beginning followed by the dangers that occur because of it.  This article is organized so that the reader is informed about space debris little by little.  After being informed on how the 'dead' object can cause harm, the reader then learns about why space pollution is becoming a major problem.       The way this article is organized helps the readers be informed on space pollution without recieving too many information at once.  The article is divided into sections then paragraphs, allowing the reader to understand more easily the information that is being given to them."
24068,9,2,1,He oragnizes the article by catching the reader's attetion before explaining the serious issues of space junk. He then explains what space junk is so we understand what he is talking about later on the article better. After he explains what space junk is he talks about the history of us invading space and how stuff gets left behind. Then he explains how space junk is a serious matter to earth and the people heading to space.
24069,9,2,1,"The author starts out explaining what space junk is and how it got up in space. Then they talk about the dangers of it being in space and the impact of the space junk collisions 'both satellites traveling at more than 20,000 mph, crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth'. Then they go into why this is all a big deal to us and the world."
24071,9,1,1,The author organized the article with different headings and sections.
24072,9,1,2,"the author starts out as if it's going to be a good story. Then the author goes into how dangrous the 'orbiting junk' can be. Under ' What is Space Junk' they tell you 'over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecrafts' have been launched into space. In ' Crash Course' the author tells you ' with no controls, dead satellites ru n the riskk of colliding with eachother' Last but not least in ' Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author tells you that 'scientists are hard-pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk'"
24073,9,2,1,"The auther puts the article together in different sections. First, there is the hook and intro. Then, there is some background info and then the statistics and current matters on this subject."
24075,9,1,2,"The author organizes the article by talking about a certain subject, but then hinting to another subject. This hint gives the reader a sense of knowing what is coming up. For instance, in the introduction she mentions space junk, but then she moves into another paragraph explaining what it is. At the end of that paragraph she mentions it 'circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit'. This led into the 'Crash Course' paragraph and so on."
24076,9,0,0,It is organized by how it happens in chronological order. The satellites would have to crash before they would have junk fall off of them.
24077,9,2,2,"In this selection the author organizes his/her main points into sections that relate and flow from one to the other. For example, he/she use the transition form the main title 'Orbiting Junk,' to 'What is Space Junk.' These sections describe what 'space junk' is. Then he/she transition into the dangfers of 'space junck,' by using titles such as 'Crash Course,' which transitions into 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites. The author organized his/her selection in a way that flows from one point to the next."
24078,9,2,2,"The author begins the article with an attention grabber, in order to make the reader interested in the topic.  Giving the reader a little information regarding space junk, the author clarifies the topic and gives details in the second section, 'What Is Space Junk?'.  Describing the main topic to the reader gives the author an opportunity to discuss the problems with this increasing volume of junk.  The author ends the passage by describing the dangers of these pieces of debris, stating that the objects in space are similar to '...[sand] shot from a sandblaster...'  The author concludes his passage with a tone of resolution; he hopes that solutions can be created to stop this growing problem."
24079,9,2,1,They talk about the defintion of space junk that is in our outer space. They give an example about when the Soviet Union launched the first satellite inter outerspace.     Then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space. The problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite. That hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space. The space shuttle isn't moving that fast and is very delicate.      The amount of space trash is increasing because the commercial space travel is up because more nations have taken space explorations. They are hopiong to come up with a solution to stop this pollution in space.
24080,9,1,1,The author divides each different part about orbiting junk into their own sections. The author doesn't fuse his or work together.
24081,9,1,0,The author first draws the readers in by using an attention grabber. Then the author gives the reader some history about space. Then he processes on telling the reader about the harmful risks that are accurring  in space.
24082,9,1,1,First the author started talking about the basic information about the space junk and then he wrote what it is use for and also talked abour all rhe dangerous and safety thins about the space junk.
24083,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article in catagories as to help the reader understand the article better. The article starts out with definition 'What Is Space Junk?', goes to how some space junk is created 'Crash Course', and then goes to why space debris is a big deal in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'."
24085,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by having headings for different topics.  This makes it easier for the reader to follow and stay on topic.  The author begins the article with a common phrase 'It's a bird!  It's a plane!  It's Superman!'  but with a unique spin.  The author then presents a heading 'What Is Space Junk' to show that the fun, friendly introduction is complete and the serious article is begninning.  From there, the author uses a new heading (ie..Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal) to show when he is about to begin a new topic."
24086,9,1,1,He starts out with a more general topic then he gets into more specific topics like space junk then he goes on to say crash course and gives a example how a american space craft and a russian craft carshed. Then the auther talks about the debris in the orbit around the earth.
24087,9,2,2,"The author orgaizes the article in different sections by explaining the different aspects of space junk such as the categories of orbiting junk, what is space junk?, crash course, and little bits, but a big deal."
24088,9,1,1,"The author of this article organizes it into four different sections. The author introduces a problem, gives the history of this problem, tells you how it occurs, the finally tells you why it matters."

24090,9,1,2,The author organizes the artice in a simple way. The author grabs the attention of the reader first. The author does this by a comical statement. Then the author goes into how serious of a problem it is right when he grabbed your attention. He gives you simple facts from history and just flat out tells you things so that you don't have to read between the lines. He tells you the basics and then sums it up by saying how important and dangerous space trash is and leaves you to think with that.
24091,9,1,1,"The author begins by giving backround information explaining how common space junk is formed, then leads into how tiny bits of space junk are formed, and finally how these small debris are a big problem."
24092,9,0,0,"The author organizes the article by putting it in order of what is space junk, to why it effects us. In the article it mostly states all of the problems people have had going into space.Their problem all talk about getting hit or crashing into something floating in space."
24094,9,2,2,The interduction gets your attion to read the artical and tells you what its going to be about. What is Space Junk gives more information on the objects in our atmosphere and what they are doing there. Crash Course tells a story about how some space junk gets in the atmospher. And the last paragraph tell how all this is really a big deal and something should be done about it.
24095,9,2,2,"They break it into sections, which allows the reading to get a better understaning. For example, in the introduction 'Grab your telescope!' allows the reader to jump on bord in a sence. In the What Is Space Junk? section 'In 1957, the Soviet Union lunched the first artificial satellite.' This give the reader facts and ideas of what is going on. In Crash Course, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding wih each other.' This shows risks and what could happen. Little Bits, But a Big Deal 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.' Shows why we should be worried."
24096,9,0,0,The aticle goes from attention getting to informational. Then it is jus importance of space junk.
24098,9,1,1,"It starts with an introduction, then it gives subheadings with facts about the subheading."
24099,9,2,2,"The author organizes the artical into groups. He explans all of the groops: What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. e explanse what will happen or what could happen in space if something runs into each other or if an astronaut droped something wile working."
24102,9,0,0,"By telling facts about satellites. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite."
24103,9,2,2,"The author first starts out with the introduction which explains what it is about. The next paragraph is 'What is Space Junk' which is telling us what space junk is which is the cause for all the debri and junk in space. The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course' which tells us what the space junk has caused in space.  The last section is 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal and it tells how people feel about the junk and what is going to happen to it all."
24105,9,1,1,Like the way he starts it of gets you in it then he start to describe them in sections and certain parts to make the article good and didn't stick on one sublect but speard it out and also had facts in the article some of the things they do when they are in space and the oblects they use
24106,9,1,1,From talking about what is space junk. Then the author talks about the most serious concepts of what space junk can do to spacecrafts in orbit.
24107,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article with specific titles for each section.  For instance, one of the titles is called, 'Crash Course.'  This section of the article explains how satelites and other debris floating in space can potentially collide and screw up satelites with will affect global communication."
24108,9,1,1,"The author organizes this article by beginning with an introduction, leading into 3 main paragraphs, and ending with a conclusion."

24111,9,0,0,He organizes it by detail.
24112,9,1,2,The author starts with a great attention getter that is a concerning statement. Then he goes into the history of when the human race first did something with space. The russians launch a satellite. Then the auther goes into how debris can get into the orbit by telling us that satellites do crash into eachother. Then he goes into how these little peices of deebris are a big deal because they can be caught and pulled down to the earth at enormous speeds.
24114,9,1,2,The author organizes this article by putting headings at the top of the page and keeps adding new ones when he changes subjects. It lets you know the good about space junk and the bad about space junk. Then it goes into the sizes of stuff how even the little pice of sand is a big deal and could really hurt your space craft.
24115,9,2,2,"the author organizes the article into sections that explain what it is, what is couses, and how we are affected. each section is wsell informed and organized. such as the two satellites colliding in the section titled (Crash Course)."
24116,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article with an introduction, and three body paragraphs.      Paragraph one gives a brief history of the 'great space invasion', and poses the question of what happens to the damaged satellites, telescopes, and space capsules that cannot be repaired.     Paragraph two begins with what may happen if two unmanned satellites were to collide in space, resulting in hundreds of 'microsatellites'.     Finally, paragraph three expresses the seriousness of the matter, stating that at extreme speeds, small objects can create huge wholes and damgae other space equpiment. A solution is difficult, but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space. It also emphasizes the growing number of satellites, capsules, telescopes etc. being sent into space, and how therefore space trash is increasing."
24117,9,1,2,This author organizes the article first with an introduction to grab the reader's attention. The introduction introduces us to what the rest of the paper is going to be about. The author then is able to explain exactly what the paper is about with 'What Is Space Junk?' He then gives us an example of what is going on with the problem and then why it is important and what is being done to help it.
24119,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by, first grabbing the readers attention, then describing what space junk really is, then how space junk is formed, and lastly why we should care about it, and what we can do to reduce space junk."

24121,9,1,0,The author organizes the article into groups.
24122,9,1,1,"The author organizes the articles by splitting them up into different sections, and they all have different titles on what the paragraph is about."
24123,9,2,2,The author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article. for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk. then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be. At the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone. That is how he organizes the article.
24124,9,2,2,"They organize it into subject matter: 'What IS space junk?','Crash Cource', and 'Little Bits, Bit a Big Deal.' They also try to catch the readers attention with the titles of the sections."
24125,9,1,1,"The author organizes this article in a interesting format. For example, he introduces us with dialouge between two people. Then he changes his tone into a serious matter and explains what he is going to talk about.      Also, he divides his paragraphs into topics so we know what the next paragraph is about. This shows that he is very organized and wants to keep us organized as well while we are reading it."
24127,9,1,2,The author organizes the story by first explaining where and when the space junk first started and where it came frm. Then the story later explains how these little problems can became a very serious matter.
24128,9,0,0,grab your telescope! look up in the sky! its a comet!its a meteor!
24129,9,1,1,The author put this articke in different collums and explains what each of the headings mean.
24131,9,1,1,"In this article, the author does a great job at organizing all of his information. I think that it was good that the author had a main title and an introduction that explained all that he or she was going to talk about, and then the author had subtitles when they were going on a new topic. I know that when the questions came up, it was very easy for me to find the answers because the subtitles organized it very well."
24133,9,2,2,The first part of the artice he uses the word space junk. Then in paragrphs 4 and 5 he explains what it is and how they circle the earth in there own orbit. In paragraphs 6 and 7he talks about what happens if two of the satelites collide together then it forms tiny peice of material that cant be seen from earth. Also in the last paragraph he tells how the tiny peices of debris still plays a big part in space.
24134,9,2,2,"The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction, and three sub topics.  I agree that 'space junk' could become a big problem.  I feel this way because the qoute, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  That qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force, and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force."
24135,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by giving information about space junk, then talking about dead satellites and there risk of colliding with each other.  The ending talks about how these small peices of spacejunk are actually a dangerous problem.  There are even titles to go along with the clasifications including: What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal."
24136,9,1,1,The author organize the article in a way that allows the reader to easily comprehend what the paragraph is describing by telling what each topic pertaines to.It also allow the reader to go back and review a certian section quickly.
24138,9,1,0,the author starts back in the day when space came to the attentions of the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. and how over the years things have progressed and how we have left jusk in outer space that could mean a threat to us at some point.
24139,9,1,1,"The author organizes his articles by bolding the new topic paragraphs. He makes it stick out and be readable for the reader to catch the eye or attention of the reader, and it informs the reader that he is switching topics within the story."
24140,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article by putting it into four main sections.  The first section is just the opening that catches one's attention.  The second section is explaining what the space just is.  Without this section, one may be confused as to what the author is talking about.  The third section is about times when objects in space have collided and made lots of debris that is still floating around today.  Finally, the last section is talking about how even though there are just tiny bits of debris, it is still very dangerous.  This is a very good way for the author to present their information."
24141,9,1,1,The article is in catagories of what happens.
24143,9,1,1,They organize thisw artical by putting main headings and under heading the talk about the subject that the heading is referring to. Then they chosse many diffrent topics and do the same thing for alll the other topics and the write about the topic.
24144,9,0,0,The author organize the article by showing the most importants ideas around the article. also in the begiining of the article he started with an catching idea. so therefore he basically know where he was going to put it in.
24148,9,2,1,"The author organizes the article into multiple sections divided by headings.  The author does this to help the reader get a better understanding about what he/she is learning about.  First, you learn about the history of space travel.  Then, you are given information on a real collision that occured a couple of years ago.  Following this, the information is then put into perspective by talking about a sandblaster.  Finally, the call to action takes place to conclude this article."
24149,9,2,1,"The author organizes the article by first explaining the origins of the microdebris that litters the solar system, then going into explaining the harmful problem that this debris is creating for the Earth's surface."
24150,9,2,2,The author organizes this article into diffrent categories. In the categorie called 'What is Space Junk?' it goes to describe the diffrent types of debris and how they become lost on our atmosphere. In the article called 'Crash Course' it describes two satelite crashes that happened in 2009 and 2008.
24152,9,2,1,"The author organized this article very well.  After introducing the piece, he went straight to informing/educating his readers about how space junk came to exist.  He then moves on to tell the readers about how satellites can be great contributors to space junk, followed by the importance of awarness and concerns of space junk.  He informs his readers how the various pieces of junk can be harmful to machinery that scientists send into space, but alo how the damage from the collisions of space junk to said machines is unavoidable.  The author then ties up the peice with how space agencies are hoping to work with other coroporations and even nations to come up with a solution to the 'space pollution'."
24153,9,1,1,"The author seperates it into sections, and in eaach section he/she puts some very interesting facts in there for the reader."

24156,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by first giving a story in the introduction along with a paragraph about orbital pathways and space junk. Then, he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph. The ending paragraph in that section, talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, Crash Course. That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path. Also, it says that accidents do happen, and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the International Space Station. This leads into Little Bits, But a Big Deal. In this paragraph, it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash? This leads into the subject that many people do, infact, care. It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion."
24157,9,1,1,"The author organized this article in a very neat way, by dividing the categories up into iindividual sections. It is very easy to read. It's rather refreshing."
24158,9,1,0,The author describes how space junk is prodused and what causes it to become small bits of space junk. The artical starts with satellites and works his way down to what microdebris is made of.
24159,9,0,0,He get information and tells it how it is bad and dangers to the world and in space.
24161,9,1,1,The author talks about different space topics. Ever part of the artcle have it's own topic an whats it's about. Like the different parts of the article.
24162,9,2,2,"This article is organized with a fairly common format. First is a small, shocking anecdote, which serves to grab the attention of the reader. Then are a few sections highlighting the necessary details the reader needs to know to fully understand the problem such as an explanation of how space junk comes to be and how space junk is so dangerous. These are followed by a conclusion paragraph highlighting the most important information to help the message sink in one last time."
24163,9,2,1,The author organizes this article from begining to end. The author starts with simple factas and attention getters then makes the way down towards the imoportant facts. The author has three major facts and he supports them with detail and then give their overall veiw of their oppion on the article.
24165,9,2,1,The author organizes this article by having headings.  The heading 'What Is Space Junk' lets you know this passage will be about space junk and what it is.  Each heading helps the reader know exactly what they will be reading about. This is a good way of keeping an article organized.

24169,9,1,2,"The authot begins by catching the reader's attention with several shocking statements.  Once the reader has learned the subject of the article, the reader then goes on to explain a simplified history of the subject of space debris.  After explaining how so many satellites have been put into orbit by multiple nations, the author gives a few examples of colisions that have occured in the recent past, followed by the damage that can be caused from these crashes.  The author concludes by highlighting the importance of the subject, refering to examples previously stated in the article, such as that concerning the lost tool bag."

24172,9,2,2,The author first uses a funny statement then uses a more serious passage about the begining of satelites. Then to how these satilites can sometimes crash causing debri to scatter. Then finally how these little peices of debri can become lethal.
24173,9,2,2,"The author of 'Orbiting Junk' effectively organizes his piece to inform the reader of the dangers of space trash. He begins with an introduction, and gives the reader interest along with the basic background needed to understand the purpose of the article.      The author then moves into the section of 'What is Space Junk,' where he proceeds to the story of the great space invasion. He tells the reader of the many satellites within our atmosphere from this race, and introduces the idea of the satellite malfunctioning and creating 'space junk.'     In 'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, but a Big Deal' the author uses strong language, unknown problems with space junk, and a real life example to convince the reader of how harmful space junk is to the human race. He ends with a conclusive paragraph that the dangers of space junk are actually increasing, leaving with the small hope that there is a solution in the works to stop the space pollution."
24175,9,2,2,The author starts out with a humorous exploration of a toolbag which is later explained. The tone is switched to a more serious one and talks about how the space junk is dangerous. The author brings in some history which is needed to explain a few things. Afterwards the article tells how the microdebris can destroy things launched into space and gives an analogy to give a picture. Then ends with how the pollution in space is increasing  and how it IS a huge problem.

24179,9,2,2,He explains what he is talking about by saying he sees some space junk in the sky. Next he explains what it is and gives some background information on it. Then he explains how it causes satellites to collide into each other. Objects in space are considered orbiting satellites which is dangerous for astronauts. Finally he explaines exactly how it is dangerous and what he can do.
24180,9,2,1,"The author organize the article by what is space junk, In 1957, the soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite. The next section is about crash course, with no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other. The last section is about little bits, but a big deal, Actually, many people do. Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem."
24181,9,0,0,He organizes it by 'Spac Junk'.

24187,9,2,2,First the author starts out very enthusiastic and wanting to actually tell you about the topic he wants to express. The author uses a very catchy introduction and it really got me hooked from the first time i read it. Then he gets serious and starts telling about how 'space junk' is really a harmfull thing and we are under estimating what it can do. Then he starts talking about crash course which tells you how people cant control dead satellites but they are still a major threat.

Finally they discuss how big of an impact this debris can have on our atmosphere and Earth's surface."
24196,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by explaining what the article is about and then telling how dangerous it can be even if it is only a small piece. 'What is Space Junk,' tells about what it is and how long it has been up there and when they figured out what it was. The section 'Crash Course,' tells about how the little particles in space can damage the satellites even if they are small pieces. The last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' tells about what the fragments can do to a satellite. It also tells how the spacecraft is designed to try to avoid the little particles, but sometimes can not avoid them all. This article explains what 'Space Junk' is and how it affects the satellites, it also explains how much damage something so little can do."

24332,9,2,2,"The author organizes his article by using different sections that each describe different aspects of space junk. The first section describes what space junk is, and what happens to it. The second section describes how some of the trash is generated, through dead satellite collisions or small things like a lost tool bag. The last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations. The debris can be undecectable by military radar and travel at such speeds to the point of being highly dangerous."
24333,9,2,1,"In this article, the author has organized it in a unique way. The author has used the providing information to contrast the harmful dangers of space junk. The article is seperated in different categories where that topic is explained. The author tries to emphasize the importance of the outcome we will have if people ignore this situation. With no one to control the dead satellites, they run with great risks of 'colliding with each other.' This can cause a harmful effect and is what happened in February 2009. This impact caused hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path."
24334,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article by putting similar information together and leading up to the conclusion. He starts with the introduction by introducing 'space junk'. Then, he provides the audience with information about what space junk is. The author then gives the audience information on how effective crashes can be in space. He finishes off by telling the audience how these small things in space can make a huge impact."
24336,9,1,2,The author organizes the problem by starting at the beggining when we first started exploring space. Then the author goes in order from there and tells us how so much debri gets into the orbit around earth. Then the author tells us how dangerous it is and how we can detect it but there is nothing we can do about it.
24338,9,1,1,"The auther organizes this article by order of importance. The auther tells about launching space crafts, then moves into the importance of space junk and how space junk creates crash courses."
24339,9,1,1,The author organizes the artical with a title and subheadings. He uses three subheadings to organize it.
24340,9,1,1,"He organizes it with history, then more current events.What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal"
24341,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article in order of importance. He first introduces the idea of space junk posing a problem, describes how it has occurred, and closes with startling information about how space pollution is a very large threat to space exploration."
24342,9,1,1,He organizes it by putting sections and paragraphs in it. also by naming everything.
24343,9,2,2,The author organizest the article very well. The author uses the introduction to get the point across. He then does a good job in explaining what space junk really is and how it is increasing as we are now doing more and more space research. This is followed by the section Crash Course which explains how space junk causes collisions in orbit. The next section emphasizes the damage this space junk can cause to space crafts and other research satellites. The ending is also very well thought out restatign the problem and showing how it is an increasing problem. I liked this article and thought it was very well organized by the author.
24345,9,2,2,"The author organizes this article by using different sections. The article uses the section 'What Is Space Juck?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The cause for this is to have everything more organized."
24348,9,0,2,They organize it by the data. In 'What Is Spave Junk' they stick to just describing certain things and then when they wanted to go to a new subject they went into 'Crash Course.' They kept all of the same ideas together instead of running them all together.
24349,9,2,1,"The author organizes this article in sequential order.  The article starts by telling you what 'space junk' is.  Then, the author tells you what affects it has on satellites.  Finally, the author explains how the debris is small and it makes it hard for astronauts to see it.This article is in sequential order because it shows the sequence in which the events happen."
24350,9,0,0,He organizes the article from most dangerous to the solutions or what we are working on to be our solutions.
24351,9,1,1,"The author starts the article with a fun attention getter, and then swtiches to a more serious organized fashion of writing. It is split into 4 detailed topics that explain space junk."
24352,9,2,2,The author organizes this piece very well do to the fact that everything is titled and is in there own little section.  For example when they talk about the debres crashing into things they placed that in the crash course section of the piece.
24353,9,2,2,"In the article 'Orbiting Junk', the author arranges the artcile in a logical sense - He starts out with the introduction, which uses rhetorical questions and well known phrases to grab your attention. He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk' with his primary thesis. The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk?', and this section has one major goal - to inform us readers with the definition of space junk. In addition, the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit. 'The objects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up'. The next section is Crash Course - this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere, through the examples of American/Russian satellites colliding with each other, or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', focuses on the hard hitting truth - that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts. The author shows how undetectable pieces of debris, also known as microdebris, can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster. The author closes his article with his conclusion - that space trash is increasing in volumn and size because of commerical space travel and how we need to undertake a solution to space pollution."
24354,9,2,2,"The author seperates the article into a build up/introduction, and then different potential issues that can arise from space junk.  The introduction goes along with 'What Is Space Junk?'(Build up). And the other sections are issues arisin due to space junk."
24355,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article by splitting up the diffrent sections of the diffrent serious matters. There's the space junk, and the reasons for it being there, and how unnecessary it is."

It's a...tool bag?'.  This passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more.  Then the reader is told that this can actually happen and that this article is going to be about space junk.  Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there.  The article explains how the space junk is the stuff that doesn't fall back to earth, so it isn't burned up in the atmosphere.  Instead it floats around in space.  The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk.  In the next section, crash course, we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide.  We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space.  But by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris.  The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits, but a big deal.  This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems.  A useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public.  Lastly, the article explains what is being done about this problem.  So, in a more general form we are hooked into the story, then given a problem, then the problem is explained in more detail, then we are told why it's a problem, and lastly what solutions are out there and what is being done to solve this problem.  This method of organization ensures that the reader is never confused, and is given the information in a logical order, answering the reader's questions directly as they come."

The next section then offers a more elaborate explanation of the topic of the article and a short history of how the problem of 'space junk' began. The author then goes on to explain what happens to the debris and how collisions occur. The last section then explains why the collisions are a problem, despite the small size of the debris.

Sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention and keeps them interested. Section two describles a little bit about the history of space exploration. It also explains what happens to satellites over time when they are orbiting in space for a long period.      Section three explains the dangers of satellites crashing in outerspace. It also gives an example of two satellites colliding with one another and spreading tiny debris all over space. Section four explains the seriousness of this debris and explains what NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to do.

This part explains how even though something can be so small and may be thought of as not a very big deal, it can still cause a lot of damage. It gives the sand example that says that something going at very high speeds can still cause a lot of damage.

Then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly Space Junk is and how it can affect us. An example would be,'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired?' Of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit. The second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite. From paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one American and one Russian, both traveling more than 20,000 mph. crashed into each other 491 mi. above the Earth. The main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. Here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'

In the body of the article the author explains what space junk is, how it got into space, and why the junk stays in space. Then the author gives an account of what happened when two satellites crashed into each other and produces hundreds of smaller satellites. After that the reader is informed of how dangerous microfragments of space junk really are and how different space agencies, such as NASA, are dealing with the issue. In the article's conclusion, the author shares with the reader that the amount of space trash is increasing rapidly and that space agencies hope to work alongside nations and corporations to stop space pollution."
24616,9,1,1,"The author starts off telling you what space junk is. Space junk is the unused or broken satellites in space and other smaller things. Then, the author tells you about dead satellites running the risk of colliding with each other. Dead satellites colliding has happened before.

24619,9,2,2,"He breaks it down into different topics. The first main section,titled 'What is Space Junk?', is about the cluttered solar system because of satellite debris. 'Crash Course' is about satellites crashing into each other and the debris that it can cause. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is about how tiny bits of debris may seem harmless but they can still do damage."

24654,9,2,2,"The author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way. They first describe what space junk is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. They do this by giving a short history on the space invasion and a short explanation on how a satellite can 'die' and hurtle uncontrolably through space. Then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'Crash Course'. They explain how satelittes can collide and create massive amounts of microdebris that continue to orbit the Earth at incredible speeds. They also show how some astronauts can make mistakes such as losing the grip on their tool bag and causing the bag to begin orbiting the earth.

The author first talks about satellites being launched into orbit, 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.'  Then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged. Then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk. 'Now, instead of two disabled satellites, there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.'"
24673,9,1,1,he gets the tittle on what he want to wright about then he goes and tittles the story haedings.
24674,9,1,1,"I would say that the author organized this passage in a way of most important and which came first. In the passage 'What Is Space Junk', it talks about how satelites began and the last passage 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal',"
24675,9,1,1,The author organizes this article great. He drew me in by the introdtuction. The author also had very good detail on space junk and he had had an excellent body. The author really did a great job on organizing his article.
24676,9,0,1,The author organizes this article in a very unique way. In the introduction he grabs your attention by stating  'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!'

24681,9,2,2,"The Author organizes this article in three different sections. They start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about, space junk. Then they go on to give one way that space junk is effective and what it does to our outer space. Finally the author tells us about how even though space junk is very small and not many know about it or realize, it is very effective."
24682,9,1,1,The author organizes this article by events that lead up to what his main topic is. he starts with the first artificial satellite and end with all the space trash in outer space now.
24683,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by first, grabbing our attention in an artful, playful manner (Lines 1-2). The author then goes on to explain how space junk is created, although in a much more serious manner. Once the reader is clear on the causes of 'space junk', the author goes in-depth on what happens to these unwanted fragments, in the way of collissions, and free-orbiting satellites. Eventually, the author concludes how these little pieces of 'space trash' become dangerous to future foreys into the field of space travel, and advises that we seek a 'viable sollution'."
24684,9,1,1,The author explains a story first for an example then he goes to his point. He tells wat space junk is then he tells why it is harfull even if we think it is not. He does this when he talks about stuff hitting each other in there orbit and when a simple toolbag could cause a problem.
24685,9,0,0,First the author tills you what the article is all about then the author tills you the dangers of it.
24686,9,1,1,"The author starts out interseting.  Then they give us statistics about what has happened in the past years.  Around the sixth paragraph they give us examples.  By the eighth and ninth paragraphs they are talking about the bag, which was mentioned in the introduction.  The conclusion of this passage is saying that they hope to one day come up with a sollution to this."
24687,9,2,2,The just use thing they know and but things where they belong. Like 'What is Space Junk' it explains to you what it is tells you everything they know baout the topic writen about the statements. They always look to make sure the things they have out in the passage makes sence with the topic it is under. They never put things that makes no sence in a passage like if they but and there was a bananas are monkey favorite food in there under 'What is Space Junk' it just dosent fit. They only use things that are clear and you help you to understand about the thing they are writing about.
24688,9,1,2,"It begins with a humorous statement meant to entertain the reader and lead him or her inot the next paragraph which tells the reader what the passage is going to be about.

24692,9,2,2,"The article is organized by first giving a history about space exploration an example being when the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite and how the United States followed along behind them. Next you are told about how things in an uncontrolled orbit collide with each other, functioning satellites, and even space ships. In the last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' you are informed that even though the space debris is small is can be dangerous. For example, even an object small than a baseball traveling at high speeds can cause large amounts of damage to satellites and space crafts. The overall organization of this starts off to tell you a history, give you examples, and detail problems that 'space junk' can cause."
24693,9,1,1,He organize it in diffrent topics in the story. Like one topic is 'orbiting junk' and the next one is 'what space is' so he switchis off on diffrent topics. witch i think keeps you more intested in the story cause theres diffrent topics.

24697,9,2,2,"The article starts off with a childish realization through a telescope.  Then it gives a brief history of space exploration, and a couple incidents of space debris; including the 2009 satellite crash and the toolbag.  It then comes out and tells you how big of a problem things from a toolbag to destroyed satellites by telling you about a sandblaster and how it works and using it as a larger scale for objects in orbit."
24698,9,0,0,He tells people how their is junk from the satelites hitting each other and that their is junk every where in the orbits.
24699,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections. The first section is called Orbiting Junk. The second is called What is space junk? The third is called Crash course. The fourth is called Little Bits, but a Big Deal. They break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article. So its not all in one combination."
24700,9,0,1,He organizes the article by what happened in the past first and then talks about what is going to happened or what could happen.
24701,9,1,1,The author organized his writing by sectioning his writing off.
24703,9,1,1,"The author organizes the article by seperating the facts of everything.  The facts that he talked about include, the clutter in space, and when they launched the first artificial satellite and space junk got started, and who is going to take responsibility for the space trash."
24704,9,2,2,"The author organized the article with an introduction to the subject of the articles comes first. Then the author gives background information about the subject by talking about space programs and how space debris is created. It also presents some of the problems caused by space junk. The second to last section talks about the details of how some other forms of space junk occur, as well as how hard it is to prevent space junk from occuring. The final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships, and how ships cannot avoid it easily. The article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk."
24705,9,2,2,"The first paragraph is to get the readers attention, and make them want to read the story. Then the tone changes in the section 'What Is Space Junk?' and because more serious. This section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it.     The next section is called 'Crash Course' and it tells about what happens when two pieces of space junk collide, and it gives example of this happening in February 2009 with two communication satellites.     Section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is the last section, and it tells about how space junk is harmful and why this is such a serious matter. The section discusses how harmful little pices of junk can be for astronauts, and our space crafts that we send into space. The last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing, and is still a problem. All nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem."
24707,9,1,1,"The author uses titles before it opens up new information. For example one of the titles is Orbiting Junk, after that the author explains with information."
24709,9,1,1,The author organizes the article by giving you information about the junk and a time when an actual space invasion occured. Then the article goes into how people might think its not a big deal but it is.
24710,9,2,2,"The author organized the article by separating information into several different sections. First, he/she explained what space debris is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. Secondly, he/she used an example of the negative effects that space debris has caused to space in ' Crash Course'.Then finally, they use information from space agencies around the world to show the effects on the countries on Earth in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'."
24711,9,0,0,IT WAS NOT ORGANIZED WELL
24713,9,1,1,The author oraginizes the article in varies ways. He first gets our attention by using questions and loud statements to get our attnetion.

24715,9,2,2,"The other orginizes this article by starting off with a introduction that gets you attention. Then is gives a brief history entitled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that secton it moves onto  a more recent accident with space junk, and finishes the article off with the dangers of the little debri."
24716,9,2,2,"The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes his article into several subtopics so that the reader can clearly see the change of subjects in the article making it easier to read. The subtopic 'What Is Space Junk' talks about and defines what space junk really is, while 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' talks about the relavence of space junk and its effect on space travel."

24719,9,1,1,The author organizes it into different subsections based of what the subject of the section is
24720,9,2,2,"First, the author talks about Space junk and tells wehen the first artificial satellite was launched. Then, the author talks about how this ''space junk'' is currently of great concern to the government agencies."
24721,9,1,1,"The author puts this article in a weird way, He or she starts by a eye catching introduction and then goes to a boring history lesson about satelittes and space junk. Then the author takes us into another exciting paragraph about satelittes crashing into each other and it just goes on and on until the article is over but somehow at the end of it all i still wanted to know more."
24722,9,2,1,"At first the author uses a suprising statement to grab the readers attention, and bring them into the article itself.     Next the author discusses the seriousness of space junk circling our planet.     The author than defines what space junk is, and than gives a brief history on where space junk came from.      The author than talks about the dangers of space junk colliding with other objects such as functional sattalites and human being who are workign outside of their spacecraft.     Finally the author talks about how dangerous even the smallest pieces of space debris can be extremely harmful, and how scientists and entire nation are working together to solve the problem of 'Space Junk'."
24723,9,1,1,The author organizes the article but making side headings of the more important things about space and space junk and orginizing information to go into those areas.
24724,9,2,2,"The organization of the article is information in each section, while collectively, the sections map out a situation that could cause 'space junk.' The introduction, which obviously introduces the topic and provides a summary of the sections yet to come is followed by 'What is Space Junk' immediately afterword. Before defining space junk, a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced. The idea of an object malfunctioning is given, and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article. Following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning, 'Crash Course' provides an example from February 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The small pieces of debris or the example given in 'Crash Course' of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying,     'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.' This section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful. The organization of the article is both informative in some paragraphs but simultaneously follows a linear, yet non-descript situational plot."
24725,9,1,0,the author organizes the artical but putting stictics in first before try to persuade the readres what really happen i think it is really good becuase people need to know the true facts.

In the section it first tells the reader what could possibly happen and then gives an example or a possible scenario.In another example the author titles a section 'What Is Space Junk?' The author tells of how 52 years of space exploration has polluted the space just outside Earth's atmosphere. Then the author describes what the kinds of 'junk' are found in space from these previous space missions.
24727,9,1,1,"The author organized this to where he could draw attention to the passage. Starting with the rehtorical questions, then describing space junk. Telling the reader how it got there, and what peoples reaction is to the space junk."
24728,9,2,2,"The author seems to organize the article with a clearly defined introduction that is titled 'Orbiting Junk' that is used to introduce the subject. The author then uses two sections to explain what 'space junk' is and why it is such a big danger. He then proceeds to have a conclusion section titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', which explains why such small pieces of debris can prove to be very harmful."
24729,9,2,2,"The introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it. 'What is Space Junk?' describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space. 'Crash Course' tells about how two satellites collided into each other in an orbit around the Earth's orbit. It also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris, it's ANY object. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' tell about how much people truly care about what's going on in space. It also tells about how dangerous microdebris can be if not avoided."

From their the author begins explaining the term 'space junk' and some space travel history as to how space debris came to be. Further on, the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be. He provides an exapmle of when two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided in space and created hundreds of pieces that now helplessly oribit earth. Then he makes a comparison with how dangerous and affective sand can be when shot at such a fast rate. He does this to prove that even the smallest fo space junk can pose a threat to space ships entering space."
24735,9,1,0,"He first explains what is beyond the Earth's atmospere and how it got there, then explains that the things that are beyond the Earth's atmospere do break and become an issue, after that he explains how they have a big effect on things."

Look up in the sky!', then move into describing the topic of their article, space junk, more clearly, 'The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk...' The following paragraphs explain how space junk comes to be, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other', and the article closes with the dangers of space junk, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.'"
24738,9,2,2,"The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes the article into four sections.  The introduction brings up the idea of space junk and explains that it is causing a global governmental concern.  The author goes on to explain what space junk is and transitions into why it is a problem in the next two paragraphs.  Finally, the author wants to raise awareness that the volume of space trash is in fact increasing and that it is difficult to avoid."
24739,9,1,1,They organize it by using ancadotes as the introductions then breaking down the article into sections that discuss the different topics.

24748,9,0,0,He puts it impportanc.
24749,9,2,2,"The author organizes the article into several sections: the intro, 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The first section defines 'space junk' for the reader. Section two explains how debris can be formed by colliding satellites, and section three explains why space junk is a problem."
