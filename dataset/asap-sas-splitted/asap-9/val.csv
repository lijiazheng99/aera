The second section pulls out the facts and starts to get serious about the matter, 'in 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.'.  The third section goes into detail about how some of the 'microdebris' came into our orbit and how easy it is to lose somthing in space. Then finaly the last section tells about the dangers and precautions we as a human race are taking to fix this problem, it then concludes the Essay."

Then the author tells us about the history of countires sending artificial satellites, starting with telling us about when the first one was launched.     Next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide. In the Febuary of 2009, two satelites, one American and one Russian, bith collided with eachother. Both of the satellites where considered disabled, and would've been much easier to remove if they were still in solid pieces. Now, they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision.     Finally, the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something. In space, even tiny particles will cause some major damage. The author refers to a gentle breeze blowing sand to using a sand blaster to remove paint off of a concrete wall to give us an accurate picture of what can happen."

He then gives you some background about spacecrafts. About what has been sent beyond Earth's Atmosphere. He also mentions how junk it shot through our atmosphere. Which can be highly dangerous. That bring you to the next paragraph.     He then describes how we have no control of what is going to happen if it is not in our atmosphere. It picks up speed and can come crashing down to earth.      These peices might be little but at a high speed rate it is dangerous because of the impact.

23802,9,2,2,"The article is organized in a chronological way. The 'lifespan' of debris, so to say. The author talks about how satellites are freely moving about the earths orbit, and will soon enough crash into one another. This creates hundreds of microsatellites, otherwise known as debris. These debris are flying over 20,000 miles per hour, and present a serious risk for anything that comes into contact with it's path of travel. The author then concludes with a sort of 'look to the future' with commercial space programs, which will only worsen the space pollution issue."

Second, we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them. The authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they 'die' and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off. Besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the ISS. Finally, we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous.           'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains                         of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot          from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete          wall.'This gives us an example of something on Earth to compare to the debris in space."

When they try to tell us that there is junk in space most people don't believe it and all the stuff falls down to Earth, nut most of it don't. I think it's sad that there is a mess in space a place that should be untouched."
23816,9,1,2,"The author organizes the article from information of the past of space junk to information of the present and how dangerous it can be. For example, it starts off in the first part stating, 'Over the past 52 years... Earth's atmosphere.' This shows the variety and past of spacecraft. The next part helps to better explain how dangerous satellites may become because of the risk they have of running into one another. This part leads into the present.

23895,9,1,2,"The Author Organizes the Articles by first saying what a space junk is. The united states followed suit and thats when the human race begun. The objects themselves, however are positioned hundreds of miles above earth.The second thing he talks about is cash course where dead stellites run the risk of coliding with eacht other like in february 2009. Not only spectacular crashes that create debris. He continues to the section Little bits ,but a big deal were it gets really serious.when a tiny fragment traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.
