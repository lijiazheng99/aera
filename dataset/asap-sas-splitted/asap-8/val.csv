It isn't until Paul gets stopped by Mr. Leonard one day that we first get a glimpse of who this hall monitor is. Many foreshadowing events occur from this point forward- the empathy in his eyes when he learns Paul can't read, the mysterious way he calls Paul to the gym and then to the track, and even the encouragement he gives to Paul gives the reader many hints on who this character is as a person. When the track coach gives Paul some interesting information to look up about this said hall monitor, that is when we really see who Mr. Leonard was. We learn how successful he was on the track, but when asked about this we also learn how unsuccessful he was off the track. Paul is very shocked to hear Mr. Leonard Grabowski was an avid hurdle jumping track participent in his day, but when he goes directly to the man behind all of it, Mr. Leonard, he gets a more personal outlook on what it was truly like for him. This gives Paul a new appreciation for his education, but also for Mr. Leonard after realizing just who this hall monitor once was, and in a way- still is."

20723,8,2,2,In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard. This information impacts Paul greatly in the story. His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.     When Paul had said 'I knew the well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alouf or when I didn't know an answer everone else knew.'

Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles, and  had trouble reading. Though it didn't seem like a problem then. His college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important. Not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship.This made Paul think of all what Mr.Leonard had done for him. Since he was going through the same. He was good in a sport but not so good as a student. Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students."
20766,8,2,2,"Paul was curious as to why Mr.Leonard had never mentioned of his running past. He seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name. When Paul found out the reasoning that Mr.Leonard had for what happened, he felt for  him. Paul knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt, the embarrasment, the lack of knowledge while everyone else had the answer, he could truly relate to him.      It occured to Paul, that in the same way Mr.Leonard had approached him, and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself, he was gonna help Mr.Leonard do the same. Paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills. And while helping him, it would also improve Paul's reading skills."
20772,8,1,2,The information he fount on Mr. Leonard had a good effect on Paul because he didnt know Mr.Leonard ran track in his freshmen year in college. He was inspired by it and the fact that Mr.Leonard was inspiring him to run track and to have his education.

20775,8,1,2,Paul is very impressed about what he hears about Mr. Leonard. The next day he asks him why he never told paul that he was such a good college hurdler. Paul wondered why he didnt continue to run after college since he was so talented and Mr. Leonard told him it was because his grades were too bad and no college wanted a runner that couldnt read so they took his scholarship away.
20778,8,2,1,"It surprises him, but he is more determined to help Mr. Leonard and do better himself. Paul sees the person that helped him not do so well in school so it would shock and surprise him.

The embarassing emotions that Mr. Leonard felt were all too familiar to Paul and gave him a sense of not being alone.  The effect that this information had on Paul was substantial, because it motivated Paul to become a better reader and athlete, not just for his sake, but for Mr Leonard's sake as well."
20806,8,0,0,he noticed that he came from being a very good track coach in a different state.
20809,8,1,2,"Mr. Leonard's background information had an effect on Paul because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had the same problem and motivation. Their problem was that both were not very strong at reading, but their strengths, hurdles, is what brought the two together as friends. Since Mr. Leonard had the motivation to teach Paul hurdles, and Paul was willing to learn, Paul could become the new Mr. Leonard, athletically."
20810,8,2,2,"He learns that Mr. Leonard is very much like him in the sense that Mr. Leonard isn't a good reader either.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul about how he was a good enough athlete to get a scholarship for running track, even though he was not that good in school.  When he explained to Paul that he began letting his lack of knowledge in school effect his persuit of being a runner in college, it helped Paul realize that he could be good at something to balance out his toubles in school, but he must still work hard in school to fully accomplish a goal.  With Mr. Leonard showing Paul how they have a common problem with school and a common interest in jumping the hurdles, Paul was able to apply Mr. Leonard's advice to his own life."
20820,8,2,2,"The background information about Mr. Leonard has an astronomical effect on Paul. Paul found a new form of respect for Mr. Leonard after reading the background information, which can be infered by Paul's astonishment of Mr. Leonard's accomplishments.

20841,8,2,2,"It has a huge effect on Paul and Mr. Leonard. When he first shows Mr. Leonard the url it makes a big impact on  him because paul now knows that he was a major track athlete. Only knowing that he coudnt finish college because he started flunking and not being able to know how to read.     Once Mr. Leonard told paul that, that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track and to not give up since it reminds him of paul since he coudnt read and he had to go to the learning center twice a week from school."
20842,8,2,2,"Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through. Paul knew how it felt to not be able to read, and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle. This is shown when it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'     The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative. He not only overcomes his inability to read, but finds an outlet, and takes leadership in both. In running track, he gets on the high school team, and in reading, is able to help Mr. Leonard learn as well."

Paul learns Mr. Leonard was an outstanding athlete, but not a good student. As the story continues, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard could not read and then flunked out of school.

20850,8,2,2,"Paul finds out That Mr. Leonard was an old track runner, and that he broke many records. When Paul confronts him, He finds out Mr. Leonard cant read, Like himself."
20854,8,2,1,The background information Paul found about Mr. Leonard made him empathetic because he knew exactly how he felt but also he became motiveated to help Mr. Leonard just as he had helped him  with hurdles. 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
20861,8,0,0,It gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory. Without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow.
20864,8,2,2,An example from the story that tells Paul some background information about Mr. Leonard is when Paul gets on the track and field website thats says Mr. Leonard was a college track star. It surprises Paul and also lets him know Mr. Leonard was a good runner. Also it inspires Paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete.

20870,8,2,2,"Paul feels like since Mr. Lenard has helped him become a track and field runner, he should help Mr. Lenard learn how to read. Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do. Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard. He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard. He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him."
20878,8,2,2,Learning that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading as well my Paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol. Before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didn't know the answer to and everyone else did. Now he realizes he isn't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident.
20885,8,2,2,"The effect it has on Paul, is that he's going throught the same things as Mr. Leonard went through. For example, when Mr. Leonard was in high school he could read either, and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin. But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability. Paul refers to this because he can't read either. All in all, Mr. Leonard, wants Paul to succeed unlike he did. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did."
20898,8,2,1,"when paul finds out that MR, Leonard was once a track star he was shocked to find out why he stoped doin track . it was becuase he was a bad student and dosent want paul to be one so hes helping him out."
20905,8,1,1,The background information showed Paul why Mr. Leonard was helping him train for track.  Also Mr. Leonard's past related to what Paul is going through.
20909,8,2,2,"The effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward Mr. Leonard. Probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler. It made him feel kind of good to know that Mr. Leonard was a hurtler, adn that Mr. Leonard was spending time teaching him how to do this. But then, upon learning that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, it probably made Paul feel kind of awed toward Mr. Leonard because he was like him in those ways."
20916,8,2,2,It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard was the same as Paul. He didin't know how to read and he was only good at track. When Paul learns he can't read he extends the favor back and decides he is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read just like he taught him how to jump hurdles.
20931,8,1,1,Paul probably feels motivated because he isn't the only one who doesn't know how to read. This motivates him to hurdle.
20941,8,2,2,"The effect it had on Paul was somewhat like the effect Paul had on Mr. Leonard; sympathy. They knew how each other felt not knowing how to read.

Upon finding out that Mr. Leonard cannot read, Paul decides that is it time to gave back to the man who made him a fast runner."
20972,8,2,2,It makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read.
20974,8,0,0,Because then he knows why he didnt say just come on it wont hurt you. Another reason is thats why he knows he couldnt read his name on the hall pass. Also instead of looking at the hall pass he just asked him where he was going. The coach just probably looked at it and pretended to read it. Then at the very end he knows he feels sorry for Paul. Also Paul feels sorry for him and tells the coach come on lets go start your training.
20976,8,0,0,"The background check on Paul would be about the same as Mr. Leonard, becasue he was very good at track and field but, he couldn't read. He wanted to help Paul get better at track and field and much better at reading. he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field."

21143,8,1,0,"It changes Paul whole outllook on Mr. Leonard and he feels sorry for him. In fact, he feels so bad for him that he starts training with him at end of the passage."
21145,8,2,1,He probably does not understand why a man who was such a great athlete is checking for hall passes at a high school. When he asks why he never told him he realises that he is pretty much in the same situation that Mr. Leonard was in.
21148,8,1,1,"The effect that the background information has on Paul makes him see Mr. Leonard as an inspiration. The information allows Paul to personally see himself in Mr. Leonard and he compares himself to him. For instance, when he reads the information from the website about Mr. Leonard, he is astonished by his accomplishments. Once Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his past, Paul is inspired by his words.

Mr.Leonard then goes on with his story about how he use to be like Paul and flunked out of college because of his grades and how he was told in high school that he couldn't do track anymore because of his grades and that in college they would have tutors for him."
21166,8,0,0,Paul didnt know why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him bout his past as being a track star. When Paul asked its because he had the same problem Paul has.

21191,8,0,0,The background information uncovered has a positive effect on the relationship between paul and Mr.Leonard. You can tell this by the last line where it is incinuated that after they practice track they will practice reading together.
21192,8,2,2,"The effect the background information ahas in Paul is that when Mr. Leonard was telling Paul all the things that was wrong, it reminded Paul of himself. When Mr. Leonard said that he couldn't read and that he wasn't smart enough to make it through college. Paul got a glimpse of his future. Paul knew that the only reason that happened to him was that he never seeked help, so that is why he told Mr. Leonard his training is to begin."
21199,8,0,0,It shows him that he can still acomplish things even if he has trouble reading. He wants to help Mr. Leaonard learn how to read that way he will not feel ashamed talking abou his college exsperience. Paul tells Mr. Leonard 'Its time to start your training.'
21201,8,2,2,"Paul is confused and somewhat angry. 'why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul was astonished at the fact that Mr. Leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment. Mr. Leonard replied with comments such as 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student.' 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul felt as if he had some of Mr. Leonard's qualities in him, and since Mr. Leonard help him he should return the favor. 'It's time too start you training.'"
21208,8,2,2,"The information effected Paul because Mr. Leonard is a great athlete. Mr. Leonard was very good in school and he fluncked out of college because of his grades. Mr. Leonard inspired Paul because they are very similar, Paul was bad at school also and Paul is also a great athlete. It gave Paul so inspiration in life to succeed."
21213,8,0,0,Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard never told him about being a champion at hurdling. He finds out that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him because he was ashamed that he had flinked out of college because he couldn't read.
21219,8,2,1,"Paul is shocked by the information about Mr. Leonard. In paragraph 45, Paul explains that Mr. Leonards emotions are similar to his own."
21224,8,2,2,"paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like Mr. Leonard,he really felt for him ."
21231,8,0,1,Mr. Leonard couldn't read either. He was in the same position as Paul when he was a kid.
21232,8,1,0,"It shows Pual that, there are hurddles in life that he will have to get over. And by doing themin the track session will accomplish that."
21235,8,2,2,Paul sees himself in Mr. Leonard. They both can't read but both are good at track.
21248,8,2,2,Paul knows that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading when he was younger too. He knows he's not the only person that can't read. If you can achieve a goal you can do anything.
21249,8,2,2,"Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read. He soon caught on that Mr. leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college. Paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read, but was getting help for it, unlike Mr. Leonard did.     In conclusion, at the end of the short story paul states,                'C'mon, Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'  Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading."
21261,8,2,2,"The effect that the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard, is similar to Paul's own life. Paul was one of the few selected to go to the learning center, and then when Paul found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college, that effect gave them simularities. The effect made Paul want to work harder, and he took Mr. Leonard to the learning center with him."
21263,8,1,2,"The effect of the background information was that Paul was understanding of how it feels to be the outcast that can not read and needed the extra help. I believe that only made Paul respect him more and relate to him more. Even though Mr. Leonard was ashamed of his disablity, Paul was accepting because he could relate.      Also it gave Paul the opportunity to return a favor to Mr. Leonard. Paul was able to help out Mr. Leonard and maybe teach him how to read better. This causes their relationship to become more of an equal respect."
21272,8,2,2,"He was suprised. In fact, he pulled out the document about Mr. Leonard's accomplishment and showed it to him. It confuses Paul because Mr.Leonard didn't seem happy about seeing the printout. It turned out that Mr.Leonard was a great at hurdles, but wasn't the best student. Because he couldn't read."
21287,8,2,2,"Paul sees himself in the background information he found about Mr. Leonard.  Paul becomes empathatic towards Mr. Leonard who can not read, and in the forty-sixth paragraph Paul foreshadows that he will teach Mr. Leonard how to read, such as Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run in track."
21289,8,1,0,Paul find out that Mr.Leonard was a very good track runner and it made him excited and asked him what happen after that. Mr.Leonard then tells him he was not a good student and paul could relate to it. Paul then realized what he can do for him.
21291,8,1,1,"the effect about the background information that has on Paul was shocking because he didnt know he was a track and field champion. He realized he wants to be more like him. when Paul ask him about his background. Mr. Leonard told him that he did but that he didnt do so good in school. After Mr. Leonard told him, it made Paul realized that it he was just like him when he was Pauls age."
21296,8,2,2,"The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling."
21305,8,2,2,Paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too.  Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read just as Paul can't. He decides that since Mr. Leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21311,8,2,2,"Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard feels. He has felt the same way before and still does in school. In a way the two are very much alike in more than one way. Both are very well runners but fail to excel in school. This makes Pual want to help himself and Mr. Leonard by putting Mr. Leonard through a different type of training, reading."
21312,8,1,1,He is very surprised he is like him. He is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself. When he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesn't know what to think. It's like he didnt even believe him at first. He is amazed to see how far he has come.
21314,8,1,1,"The background information on Mr. Leonard about him being a good athlete was shocking to Paul. As Mr. Leonard went on about his college life, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is remedial to reading also. They have so much in common because they both got put last in every thing and no one wanted them because of there remediation."
21318,8,2,2,The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is that he knows the feeling and feels really bad for him.  Paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read. Now Paul wants too help Mr. Leonard learn how too read.
21319,8,1,1,"The background information on Mr. Leonard shows Paul that even those who struggle have the gifts to be great at things. Before the background information is given, Paul failed to see the connection that he had with Mr. Leonard. After Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard's past, he realizes the similarities between their situations and can connect the reasons Mr. Leonard is helping him."
21324,8,2,2,The infromation that Paul finds out makes him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also.  This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21329,8,2,2,"One effect that learning about Mr. Leonards track history had was giving Paul the idea to help Mr. Leonard to read. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard.     Knowing his past could have also given Paul a reason to excel in track. Since Mr. Leonard failed out of college although being an excellent althelete, Paul might want too prove himself to Mr. Leonard and himself that he can succeed. Also, if Paul succeeds, Mr. Leonard does too, since he taught Paul everything."
21334,8,1,1,"I belive that the background information that Paul found out about Mr. Leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams. Paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports, but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in."
21341,8,0,0,He probably didn't know that Mr. Leonard ran track and broke many records. He had to keep that a secret from Paul. So his hopes wouldn't come crashing down just because he couldn't read. He didn't want that to happen to Paul.
21344,8,1,1,It effects Paul because now he realizes that to get into college he has to do well in School. He knows this now because Mr. Leonard dropped out of college because he couldn't make the grades even though he had scholarships.
21345,8,2,2,"When Paul received information about Mr. Leonard he was shocked. He did not know that he was a record breaking track runner, or that he did not finish track and for that matter collage."
21357,8,0,0,It tells the reader qbout him as well as adding aditions to the story.
21362,8,2,2,"Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading just like him. Also, Paul understands why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him be good in a sport that he liked because Mr. leonard didn't want him to be left out the same way he was when he was in college."
21363,8,2,2,Paul does research and realizes that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler who broke records in only his freshman year. When he questions Mr. Leonard what happened to him Leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read'. This touches Paul because he cannot read either. It makes him feel much more comfortable around Leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar 'hurdles' in life.
21365,8,0,0,"When Paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. Leonard.  Paul wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he was a college track superstar.  Therefore, Paul asked Mr. Leonard that exact question the next day."
21374,8,0,0,"The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard has an effect on him. He didn't know, at the beginning, that he was being trained by someone who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.      Mr. Lenonard didn't want to tell Paul at the beginning because he thought that if he had told him, he wouldn't want to train or try something new. However, if Paul had known, things may have been better or would of had a better outcome when he was training.      The saying, 'don't judge a book by it's cover', has meaning here. Mr. Leonard is the book, and just because he's the hall monitor doesn't meant that he didn't have a successful past. Paul getting to know Mr. Leonard was a way for him to become someone."
21375,8,2,2,Paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star.
21377,8,2,2,"Paul is effected by finding out Mr. Leonard's backround as a star in track is, Paul becomes inspired to do well in track, just like Mr Leonard."
21380,8,2,2,"I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past."
21381,8,1,1,He begins to understand why Mr. Leonard was so nice to him and that he just wanted Paul to do well in track but also do well in school.
21386,8,1,1,paul is very simpathetic and so he teaches him to do hurtles. he tells the nararator that he needs to meet him in the gym at 2:30
21390,8,2,2,"The background story of Mr. Leonard is something that is familiar to Paul. Mr. Leonard had went through school not knowing how to read. He had a difficult time throughout high school and college. He had nobody to help him. Paul has help, from both his tutor and Mr. Leonard. He feels as if all the help Leonard has given, he should return some of it. Paul wants to help him, just as he helped Paul."
21392,8,2,2,When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship. When Paul told Mr. Leonard that he knew about he history in track and wanted to know why he did not tell him of his great achivements. When Paul hears that he flunked school because he could not read Paul feels for him because he is in the same situation and knows how it feels.
21394,8,0,0,Paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions.
21395,8,1,1,"Paul was working on his hurdling and the high school track coach came up and talked to him. Paul got a URL for the Track and Field website, and the coach said 'do a search for 'Grabowski.' Which Grabowski is the guy that has been training Paul to be good at Hurdles. Once Paul did his search on his trainer he was surprised about the things that Grabowski did."
