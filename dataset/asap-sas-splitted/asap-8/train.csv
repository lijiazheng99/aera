20079,8,0,0,Paul was a nervous person and he wanted to make his teacher and coach happy if he runs through the hurdles to get past the obsticles not just on the track but also about life too. He wanted get away from his fears so that he can move on with his personal life.
20080,8,2,2,He knows where Leonard is coming from because he isnt that good of a student either. He then wants to help Leonard because he had helped him with track.I found this out from the last two paragraphs of the story.
20081,8,1,2,"At first, Paul only thinks of Mr. Leonard as a hall monitor who checks his pass twice a week. Then, Mr. Leonard helps him seek an extracurricular activity, he is interested in and Paul doesn't quite understand why he is helping. After talking to the track coach, looks up Mr. Leonard on the internet, and talks to him about his past experience with track and learning, he then understands what he is trying to do for him. Mr. Leonard was in the same position as Paul and understand how he feels when it comes to school. So, he tries to find something that Paul will succeed in to help him build his confidence. After, Mr. Leonars helps him, Paul feels as if he should give back and help Mr. Leonard in return."
20082,8,2,2,Paul is concerned that Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul about his track career before. When he asks Mr. Leonard about it he finds that Mr. Leonard can't read either. He sees that even though Mr. Leonard can't read he still had a great accomplishement. This gives Paul hope that he can be good at something too.
20083,8,1,2,Paul was shocked that he broke records.he was supprised that Mr.leonard did that.He also learned that he went to colledge but didn't stay in
20084,8,0,0,makes him feel like he knows the person better since they have all that information about him.
20085,8,1,1,"Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but not a good student, not because he didn't try but because he couldn't read very well. Paul and Mr. Leonard are similiar because they are both good at hurdles but they had trouble reading. 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out.' He wanted Paul to be a good reader so that if he gets a scholarship for hurdles than he wouldn't lose it because of his grades."
20086,8,2,1,It helps moviate him to become a better reader and to try to help someone less forturnate.
20088,8,2,2,"Paul realized Mr. Leonard was like him in many ways.  He realized that although he couldn't read either, Mr. Leonard suceeded in a way.  Paul has the oppurtunity to do something Mr. Leonard couldn't, be a good athlete and learn to read.  Mr. Leonard didn't have learning centers, Paul realized how blessed he really was."
20089,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard was just like Paul at his age. He could not read. But then Mr. Leonard does what his former coaches did for him, and Paul taught Mr. Leonard how to read."
20091,8,1,0,"When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past he is very thankful for the help on the track. He now knows that even though he cannot read as welll as some others, he is still very fast and can be one of the best thanks to Mr. Leonard's help."
20092,8,1,1,The background information that pauls recieves about Mr.Leonard has an effect on paul because it lets him know he can do anything he put his mind to even if he has weak points.
20094,8,2,2,After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a great track star is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about running in college.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul that he could not read and flunked out of college Paul knows how Mr. Leonard felt because he could not read at the beginning of the story.  After Paul hears Mr. Leonard tell him about his reading troubles he takes Mr. Leonard to the learning center to help him for once learn how to accomplish something.
20095,8,2,0,He was kind of concerened why Mr. Leonard never mentioned that he was a great runner that broke records.
20099,8,1,1,"Mr. Leoanrd's background taught Paul a valuable lesson on doing well academically and in sports. For example, Mr. Leonard words were familiar to Paul and they were feelings of embarrassment."
20100,8,2,2,The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard is encouraging to Paul. Paul knows how it feels to not be able to read so he wants to help Mr. Leonard.  At the end of the story he walks back to the school telling Mr. Leonard that it's time to start his training. The background information of Mr. Leonard encourages Paul to help the hall monitor out.
20102,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard's story has a powerful effect on Paul.  It helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles.  Many people have gone through what he is going through.  They had a lot in common.  Paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability.  Paul is actually lucky.  When Mr. Leonard was in school, they didn't have learning centers to help people read.  Paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received.      Paul looks at what he has been given and the time and effort Mr. Leonard has put into him and decides that he should give something back.  He takes Mr. Leonard to the school for some 'training' in reading."
20103,8,2,2,It makes him surprised and made him wonder why he wasn't still doing hurtles until he found out from Mr. Leonard that he couldn't read. The narrator was very impressed especially with him winning the 400 meter hurtles at the nationals and the fact that he broke records.
20104,8,1,1,When paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard he was very surprized also he wondered what happend to him. He understude him because Paul also was not good in school.
20105,8,0,0,he finds out about his colledge track succes and wants to be like him.
20106,8,1,1,It has an effect on Paul becuse it sounds just like him. Paul cant read very well at all. He gets help which Mr. Leonard did not really have the chnce to get help from teachers only students. Paul want to exel in school and track. He wanted to over come his obsticals. The hurdels repersent the obsticals in life and Paul could over come them if he just trye. Paul is trying his very beast to become the beast on the team and at school.
20107,8,1,1,"It makes Paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to meet him in the gym at 2:30. It explains why Mr. Leonard cares anything at all about Paul, because he is a school hall monitor."
20108,8,0,1,paul is always getting picked last and so was leonard. they both cant read so they are just alike. and now they are both really good at jumping hurdles.
20109,8,2,2,The effect that the background information had on Paul was shock.  He was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star.  Paul was also confused.  He wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.  Paul asked 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'  Paul couldn't believe it.  That is why I think Paul was both shocked and confused.
20110,8,2,2,"When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard's track career ended because of receiving poor grades, Paul felt sorry for him. He knew Mr. Leonard was a nice man and had gone out of his way to help him, so Paul automatically wanted to return the favor by helping Mr. Leonard in his struggles as well. Paul relates to Mr. Leonard in the way that he knows what its like to be one of the ones who doesn't get good grades, and being embarassed about the fact of not being able to read near as well as others. Paul immediately realizes all that Mr. Leonard has helped him accomplish, and he wants to help Mr. Leonard accomplish something of his own."
20111,8,0,1,Paul thinks he cna over come anything ads long as he can stick with it and practice. At first Paul was not a very good runner. Then Mr. Lenord told him to bring sneakers and shorts the next day. Whne Paul got serious about running and put his mind to running the he would do very good at running. So if Paul can Practice and be good at running he will not be picked last any more for sports and will do good at his favorite sport.
20112,8,2,2,"The background information that Paul received about Mr. Leonard helped him to realize why Mr. Leonard had been helping him to excel at running. Paul felt a connection with Mr. Leonard, and wanted to do whatever he could to help Mr. Leonard achieve his goals in return for Mr. Leonard helping Paul to learn how to run. This is evident in the story in paragraph 45, where Paul narrated, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul also said in paragraph 45 that 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me...feelings of embarrassment...' Paul was now able to empathize with Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard empathized with him, and an even stronger friendship between them was formed."
20113,8,1,0,"When Paul gets background information in Mr. Leonard, he sees that, just like Paul, he struggled with reading and was also a runner.  Paul foreshadowed Mr. Leonard's story growing up through high school and college."
20114,8,1,1,Paul was empithetic because he to knew how Mr. Leonard was feeling. 'I knew them well-feelings of embaressment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't konw an answer everyone else knew.'
20115,8,2,2,"Learning about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in many ways. When he realizes that Mr. Leonard was a successfull hurdeler, he feels proud and surprised that Mr. Leonard would take the time to help Paul succeed. When Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard's struggle to learn, Paul feels a connection with him. He understands how Mr. Lownard felt and after hearing his story, he knows that he wants to do well in school. Before he didn't realize how much not being able to read could effect your future. Learning Mr. Leonard's background information helped Paul be even more determined to succeed."
20117,8,1,1,The effect it has on Paul is suprised. He was working with somone who was really good at what he was teaching this kid. Paul was excited that he has someone to relate to and he might become sombody.
20118,8,2,2,The information that Paul recieves from the website the track coach gave him made paul realize something. When Mr. Leonard asked Paul about the learning center Mr. Leonard let paul go after he told him he couldnt read. Now the information that Paul got effected him by making him realize that since he cat read it doesnt mean that he cant be good at other things like sports. Because after Paul gave the information printout to Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard told him that since he couldnt read he had to quite track because he couldnt read and because of his grades in school. And after he was told that Paul realized that Mr. Leonard was just like him in the sense that they both couldnt read and that since Mr. Leonard helped him Paul has to help Mr. leonard learn to read.
20119,8,1,1,"After learing this background information, Paul realizes why Mr. Leonard is just like him."
20121,8,1,1,"Paul realizes that it is not just him that has problems. Anyone can over come the problems that one might have in life, and still better themselves."
20124,8,2,2,"Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels, he also has a difficulty reading and he understands how it feels to be embarrased about the lack of reading skills. This brings him closer to Mr. Leonard because he starts to realize they are alike in many ways other than running."
20126,8,2,2,Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's background information because Mr. Leonard can't read just like Paul and Mr. Leonard could have been a huge track star if he would have focused on his school work in high school. Paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody.
20127,8,0,0,"Paul was worried about his reading dissabilities. Mr. Leonard was pushing paul to be good at track, becuase Mr. Leonard knew that paul would have a better chance then he ever would at succeeding in track and in studies."
20128,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard used to be a good track star, but ended up dropping out because he couldn't read. When Mr. Leonard finds out Paul can't read he helps him get better at hurdles. Then since Mr. Leonard helped Paul get better at something, Paul helps Mr. Leonard get better at something he was bad at."
20129,8,1,1,"Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's beackground information because it is the same thing he is going through, And Paul feels empathetic towards Mr. Leonard."
20131,8,0,0,The background information has a effect because he didn't know that he was in track and it would have been easier for Paul to say something to him if he knew about it.
20132,8,0,0,Paul is used to obeying Mr. Leonard. He does not ussualy stop and talk to him and seems a little nervous around him.
20133,8,2,2,The background information changes Paul's view on the Mr. Leonard. He knows now that he can help Mr. Leonard read while Mr. Leonard teaches him how to hurdle in a sort of compensation in Paul's eyes. Paul feels more motivated at the end of the story because Mr. Leonard is like him in so many ways that he feels he can achieve something like he had done in college.
20137,8,1,1,"The information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul greatly. Paul now has to goals to strive for, hurdles and reading. Mr Leonard's personal feats will push Paul harder and further to reach his goals."
20138,8,1,1,"Paul found information on the website Mr. Leonard asked him to look up. He found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete in college. Leonard won a 400 meter hurdles at Nationals, but he couldn't continue on in college because his grades were poor. Leonard didn't want Paul to be like him. He wanted paul to be able to be a reader and a athlete at the same time. So he helped paul train and Paul helped him how to read."
20139,8,2,2,"The effect on the information that Paul has received is remarkable information to him. He finds out that the teacher that is willing to help succeed and was doing it with a hurdle, was actually a really good hurdler in school. When Paul takes back the information to ask Mr.Leonard about the article. Paul comes with a grin on his face, that to me seems like hes amazed and feels pretty grateful for someone like Mr.Leonard to come and encourage him to keep trying with the hurdle."
20141,8,2,2,The backround information about Mr. Leonard excites Paul because Paul is likeing doing track every day and is ammazed by the success that Mr. Leonard has had with track in college. Then the information about how Mr. Leonard couldnt read inspires Paul because Paul is going through the same thing.
20144,8,2,2,"Paul feels he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul knows how if feels to not be able to read. He knows how it feels to be embarrassed when called upon to read aloud. Also, he knows how it feels to not know the answer that everyone else knew."
20146,8,0,0,The backgroung information affected Paul by letting him know Mr. Leonard can't read too.  This shows Paul that he can get better and not give up.  It also build his relationship with Mr. Leonard by going to the learning center together.
20147,8,2,2,Paul is amazed. He couldn't believe that he broke records in the 400 meter hurdles in college.
20148,8,2,2,"Paul was surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had, at one time, run track. This is evident in paragraph 35 line two when Paul pulls the printout from his pocket and asks, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul also began to relate to Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard told him that he also couldn't read. This fact can be found in paragraph 45 lines 2 through 4 when Paul said, 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Finally, Paul felt that he should be kind and help Mr. Leonard learn to read, just as Mr. Leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles. The final paragraph reads, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'"
20149,8,2,2,"Paul found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, like himself. He also found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he couldn't go any further in track than he did because he couldn't read. With finding that out Paul wanted to go further so he knew he needed to work hard to improve on his reading and also that maybe him and Mr. Leonard could work on it together."
20150,8,2,2,"The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul in life, because no one helped Mr. Leonard. Instead of just letting Paul continually struggle through life and not have anyone to help him Mr. Leonard steps up and gives Paul what Mr. Leonard himself never had."
20151,8,2,2,The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help Mr Leonard. It surprises Paul because he asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him that he was a track star. The information also encourages him because at the end of the reading Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20152,8,2,2,He finds out that mr. Leonard is a poor reader and Paul is also a poor reader and it makes him want to try harder.
20153,8,1,2,"In the beginning of the story Paul thinks Mr. Leonard is just the hall montitor. Then after he gets the background information on Mr.Leonard his viewpoint changes. He realizes that Mr. Leonard is just like him, but Mr. Leonard didn't have a learning center to help him read when he was in school. This caused Mr. keonard to flunk out of college which is why he is helping Paul. Also the background information makes Paul emphatic towards Mr. Leonard and will probably cause him to go to college and not flunk out for Mr. Leonard."
20154,8,0,0,The background information influences Paul. It is because of the information that he wants to join the track team.
20155,8,1,1,After he found out so much information about Mr.Leonards background it incouraged him to work even harder. He started to believe in himself. He new that he could accomplish anything as long as he put his mind to it. Not only did he believe in himself Mr.Leonard believed in him too.
20156,8,2,2,"Paul feels the same Mr. Leonard does,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had to given the time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.     Paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for Mr. Leonard too.'C'mon, Mr. leonard,' I said walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'' Paul is inspired to help out Mr. leonard so he can properly read even though he flunked college, he is eager to help.It's one of the best things to do is help someone, even if they are 10 or 50 years old they can always learn new tricks."
20157,8,0,0,"In this story, the background information about Mr. Leonard, especially at the end, is similar to the situation the narrator was in.  For example, at the end, when Mr. Leonard mentioned that he had failed out of college, which was comparable to the situation the narrator was in because of his inability to read.  Realizing this, Mr. Leonard thinks that by having the narrator do what he did, he can overcome the obstacles, which were similar to the obstacles he had."
20158,8,0,0,"The effect that Paul had was consideration more than anything because Mr. Leonard was just a  hallway monitor when he could of been so much more than that. When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard, he wanted to find out why Mr. Leonard 'gave up' on his dream, but he later found out that he flunked out of college. Paul found this out because he look up that URL that the track coach gave him and he asked andpushed the answers to Pauls questions. So he tried to live his dream out on Paul in a way."

20160,8,1,1,"He was suprised to discover that he was so good at one point in time and he wanted to know what happened, and why their weren't any other stories."
20162,8,0,0,In the baxkgroung ionformation it effects paul majorly because he thought that the teacher was great!! He did not know that he ran track or did any field activities until he recieved that website from a coach.  He was kind of upset about it but he got up and encouraged his teacher to get back on the track.
20163,8,2,2,"When Mr. Leonard tells Paul, 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work was a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost mt scolarship and fluncked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' I feel that it opeed Pauls eyes and made him think if himslf. I belive that information made Paul think of his future and how him and Mr. Leonard aren't that different. Also, when Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' 'It's time to start your training.' I feel Paul and Mr. Leonard are closer because Mr. Leonard told Paul thoes secret things about him."
20167,8,2,1,"The background information about Mr. Leonard makes Paul realize that eventhough  he might be terrible at reading, he needs to keep practicing and overcome his fears, just like he has done with the hurdles."
20169,8,0,1,The background that Paul got of Mr.Leonard effected him possitively. Now that Paul knows just because you can't read doesn't mean you can't do anything you put your mind to.

20173,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard helps Paul find something that he can be good at, and Paul probably takes Mr. Leonard's kindness for granted. He is certainly grateful for Mr. Leonard's kindness, but fails to see Mr. Leonard's motives. When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's background, about his track and field records and how he flunked out of college, it profoundly changes Paul's view of Mr. Leonard.      According to Paul, 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something'. He realizes that Mr. Leonard fully understands Paul and that he's trying to give Paul confidence to succeed. Mr. Leonard's story also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return, by helping him improve his reading skills."
20174,8,0,0,"Mr. leonard is like Paul, a poor reader. so he feels bad for him. also he sees himself in him by taking him to the track. He is good at track just like he was. Also he was a poor reader and thats why he flunked out of college."

20179,8,1,1,"At first, Paul probably felt confused and upset with Mr. Leonard for not telling Paul about his past, but when Mr. Leonard told him why he didn't tell Paul, Paul understood why.  They were both in the same situation, somewhat."
20181,8,2,2,"During the story 'Gifts' Paul learns some interesting and shocking information about Mr Leonard. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a 400 meter champion and he questioned him what happened after, once Mr. Leonard reveals the information to Paul, he was shocked. Paul realized that he wasn't alone and he had someone who was like him, someone who couldn't read. Knowing this, Paul was releaved and was glad to help Mr. Leonard with his reading."

They when paul figured out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college, paul knew felt his pain. Paul also has a hard time in school. Paul wanted to do something for Mr. Leonard because he helped him with hurdles. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard read."
20188,8,2,2,"He feels that it was strange that Mr. Leonard doesn't share with him his past acheivements, when he's training him to run hurdles.  So he is supprised that Mr. Leonard is such a great hurdler, and it prompts him to ask why he didn't continue that carreer.  When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard flunking out of college he felt sympathetic for him because he couldn't read either."

20190,8,2,2,Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that he flunked out due to bad grades. Paul was suprised that someone that good was teaching to him to succeed like Mr.Leonard did.
20191,8,1,2,"When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard struggled with the work required of him in high school and college, he feels immediately sympathetic toward the hall monitor because of his similar situation. In my opinion, he most likely felt more of a connection with the older man at this point, and he realized at last why Mr. Leonard was so determined to coach him in track after school. As is usually the case with students and their teachers, Paul is probably also somewhat surprised to discover that Mr. Leonard has had his own difficulties in life.     However, Mr. Leonard's story also has another effect on Paul - It encourages him to work harder so he doesn't suffer the same fate. After this, Paul will probably try to put more effort into his studies and receive better grades in his classes. After being confronted with the possibilities of what could happen to him if he doesn't do so, he probably has more determination not to end up losing all that he hopes to achieve like Mr. Leonard has.     Paul is also probably grateful to the learning center at his school, which he took for granted in the past. Although he initially viewed it as something to be embarrassed about, he most likely is now thankful that he has people to assist him and motivate him when Mr. Leonard didn't have the same luxury."

20202,8,2,2,The effect that Mr. Leonard's background information has on Paul is he can relate to him. Paul has a difficult time reading and was never involved with sports. Mr. Leonard can't read but was a very good athlete. Both of them are like one another and know how the other feels. They both feel embarrassed because they can't read but like to do hurdles. Since Paul discovered this information he wants to help Mr. Leonard read just like Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to do the hurdles.

20207,8,1,1,"The background information Paul received was shocking, but inspirational. He didn't know that mr. leonard was going through the same thing as he was when he was in school. So he tried to help Paul earlier than when he was in school, because he didn't have anyone to help him early in life."
20208,8,1,2,Paul is confused and probably a little disappointed that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his college days. Paul also understands when Mr. Leonard tells him about his flunking out. He says how the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to him.
20209,8,2,2,After Paul got a background check on Mr. Leonard it had really touched him. Mr. Leonard explained to him that he had flunked out. So Paul felt empathetic and took him to the learning center.
20210,8,2,2,"When reading the article, the reader first sees Mr. Leonard as a kind of mean guy, that just likes to heard people along in the hallways at schoool, because he is a hall monitor. Later on in the story when Mr. Leonard takes Paul under his wing to teach him how to be a good runner the reader learns that Mr.Leonard used to be a very succesful track runner, and used to be very well known. The reader also learns that he flunked out of college, and that's why he is no longer a runner.      Paul is a kid that can't read, and Mr. Leonard seemed to take an interest in him and was going to help him learn how to be a good runner, because he thinks it will help him out. Paul listens to Mr. Leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well. In the process of joining the high school track team Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a very well known track star. This confuses Paul on why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.     When Paul asks why he wasn't told he learns that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him because he didn't want to brag about how good he used to be, and that he was also embarrased because he had flunked out of school because he couldn't read.          The fact the Mr. Leonard took Paul under his wing to help him accomplish things in life better, and that Mr. Leonard wanted to help Paul because he never got any help tells the real type of mean Mr. Leonard is and Paul sees that and is very greatful."
20211,8,2,2,"The background information that the Paul finds on Mr. Leonard is very emotional for him because he dicoovers the reason that Mr. Leonard is so motivated to help him. Paul has the same problem that Mr. Leonard has with reading, but the only difference is that Paul gets help for his reading and Mr. Leonard didn't. So when he sees an apportunirty to help Paul  he does and is return Paul helps Mr. Leonard in the end."
20214,8,2,2,"During the story, the reader gets background information about Mr.Leonard. The effects of that background information make Paul realize that he needed to work hard for things that he wants in life. This information also makes Paul realize that he also experiences the same feelings while he's at school. An example with details would be, 'The emotions in Mr.Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well- feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Also, Mr.Leonard's background information makes Paul want to excel at something, and Paul wants to help out Mr.Leonard."
20215,8,1,1,When Paul finds this information it leads him to feel a connection with Mr. Leonard. Paul knows that this man understands the feelings of embarrassment that Paul has during school or when he is trying to read.
20217,8,2,1,I think that the background effected Paul in a good and bad way. Paul understands and knows how Mr. Leonard feels. Paul tells Mr. Leonard to come on and that it is time to start his training.
20218,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but not a good student like Paul. Mr. Leonard had the same problem as Paul but didn't have learning centers in high school, he had to use his friends for help, but it was still too hard for him."
20219,8,2,2,In the story paul learns that mr. leonard was very talented at hurdles and even broke records as a college freshman. I think that this information paul learns has him a little confused on what happend to make Mr. Leonard in the postion that he is today. when Mr. Leonard explains to him that he wasnt the strongest student and cant read very well it ties the whole story together and i think paul then realizes why Mr. leonard wants to train him. In  the end of the story they kinda let us believe that paul is going to now help mr. Leonard with his reading.
20223,8,1,1,"After learning about Mr. Leonard's background, I think Paul starts to understand Mr. Leonard better.  He used to be a suspicious quiet man but now Paul feels that he and Mr. Leonard are alike in the fact that they both had trouble in school. Paul feels more comfortable knowing that Mr. Leonard is like him and that he understands how Paul feels."
20224,8,1,1,Paul begins to feel empathetic for Mr. Leonard because he knows what it's like to fell embarrassed when he was called upon to read and couldn't or didn't know quite as much as the other kids. I think he also realizes that there are others that have reading problems and can set those aside and work hard to achieve set goals.
20226,8,1,1,"Mr. Leonard's story is one that matches Paul's struggles with reading. This information affected Paul in a way that shows even the someone with a reading problem can be anything they want to be, even a track star. He is glad to know that someone else has had the struggles he has, and can relate to his battles with homework and reading."

He kept the information about his past away from Paul because he was extremely embarassed about him failing, and flunking out of college.          When Paul found out about Mr. Leonards accomplishments, he was confused as to why he never said anything to him. Then Mr. Leonard explained to him about how he was never a very good student but colleges didn't care because he was such a greath athlete. When Paul is told that he was a awful reader also, he felt compelled to ivite Mr. Leonard to his learning center."
20233,8,0,0,The Information has a big effect on Paul because he was wondering why Mr. Leonard was wanting him to run track. He finds out that Mr. Lenord was a College star in hurdles and he could not read well eather so he wanted Paul to have a life like he wanted to have.
20235,8,2,2,I think it gives Paul some encourgement knowing that he was taught and trained by a national winner in track. It alos opens up a few connections he as with Mr. leonard about being able to talk about track instead of just the learnign center.Mr. Leonard is a role model of Paul
20236,8,0,0,"Mr. leonards background is being a track hurdler, which paul wants to find a sport that he can do. so his teacher helps him and coaches him. They both have or had problems with reading and they both got help for it."

20238,8,0,0,The way the reader reads the story and gets background information on Mr. Leonard is a way that you can also get background information on Paul. You can tell Paul is more shy that some people by the story telling you that Mr. Leonard is empathetic for him. Paul might be one to get discouraged a lot or easy because Mr. Leonard describes how he keeps his track history to himself because he does not want to discourage Paul.
20240,8,2,2,He felt connected to him because he knew how it felt to be embarrased about not being able to read well. He wants to repay him for all the help Mr. Leonard gave him.
20241,8,1,2,When pual finds out about Mr. Loenard he is kind of inspired and seems like he wants to live out Mr. Loenards dream for him because he never really got the chance to. so  he finds out and tells him to come with him and train .

'"
20246,8,2,2,"What Paul had found out, I think helped him to persue in his learning and to help him be good in the hurdles. I think that Paul started to think to realize that education is one of the highest things that you can get. Paul saw Mr. Leonard as a great athlete who didn't have the good grades to finish the total package. I think that Paul will learn that you have to be smart and have an education and then the rest will come later."

20252,8,2,2,"Paul couldn't believe the details about Mr. Leonard's past and wonders why Mr. Leonard never shared this with him. Mr. Leonard was a fantastic hurdler but not isn't very studious. Mr. Leonard couldn't read, so he flunked out of college and was embarrassed about it. This is similiar to Paul's situation. They both are good hurdlers, they couldn't read, and they felt embarrassed about it. So once Paul hears about how Mr. Leonard can't read, he wants to train him to read just like Mr. Leonard trained Paul to be a good hurdler."
20253,8,2,2,"The effect it had on Paul was that he didn't understand it, thats why he says to Mr. Leonard 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'

20456,8,2,2,"The background information Paul gets about Mr. Leonard effects Paul becuase, he learns that Mr. Leonard has the same feelings, and the same problem he does.

20458,8,0,0,The affect the background information has on Paul is that Paul had no clue that Mr. Leonard ran track and was really good. When Paul found out he talked to Mr. Leonard and ased him why he never told him and the reason was because Mr. Leonard could not read either.This had a big affect on Pauld because Paul could not read either but was really great at track.

20465,8,2,2,"It gives Paul confidence because now he knows he is not the only one that is not able to read either. At the beginning of the story he felt all alone, and was tired of always being the last one chosen for a game. When Mr. Leonard came along and helped boost his confidence. When he found out the things about Mr. Leonard it made him want to do good for others that struggle. And so therefore Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard how to read."

He was curious to why Mr. Leonard had not ran anymore after that. Once Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard had gone through the same thing he was he knew how Mr. Leonard had felt because he had the same feelings of embarrassment. Mr. Leonard could not read either, so when he went to college he lost his scholarship and flunked out, but no other school wanted a runner that could not read.

20490,8,2,1,"He realizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him because he does not want Paul to fail in college like did. Paul relizes that Mr. Leononard is helping him because Mr. Lenonard was in the same position he was in at that age and didnt do anything to better himself, and he wants better for Paul."
20492,8,2,2,"During the story. the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard. This background information has an interesting effect on Paul because Paul is unsure why anyone that good would be unknown.  Paul assumes that Mr. Leonard would have told him about his time as a college freshman winnning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, breaking the previous record, as stated in the text.  Then after learning the complete story for how Mr. Leonard went to college still unable to read and flunked out, loosing his scholarship. Paul then connects this information with how Mr. Leonard asked his name when he read his pass twice a week, every week, and concludes that he still is unable to read and Paul decides to start tutoring Mr. Leonard to teach hi to be able to read since Mr.Leonard had taught him to run and jump hurdles very well."

After researching him, Paul asks what happened and Mr. Leonard explains that his studies werent the best and that he couldnt read.

20498,8,2,2,"When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's past track excellence, he becomes inquisitive, then empithetic.  Paul's natural curiosity is demonstrated by his confronting Mr. Leonard about the startling information he discovered online.  His continued curiosity is demonstrated through his continual questioning and prying such as in '`But you went to college,'' and 'I pressed'.'

Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was the exact same way back in his high school years. Mr. Leonard accomplish much, by setting national records and being one of the best runner. This is told when the article says, 'You were a college freshmen who won the 400 ,eter hurdles at nationals. You broke records.' (line 38-39). This proves to Paul that even though he is unable to read well, he is still able to be the best at something else i his life.     Mr. Leonard also encourages Paul whenever he tells about how he was unable to complete college because he is unable to read. Mr. Leonards says, 'I lost my scholarship and flunnked out.' (line 47). This statement is important to Paul to because it helpps him realize that he still has to learn to read even if he is a good runner. Paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he doesn't learn to read. So this encourages Paul to work hard and learn how to read."
20501,8,2,2,The effects that Mr. Leonards past was on paul was that it reminded paul of himself. He felt the embarrisment When he was called apone to read or when he did not know an awnser every one else new.

It motivates him to work harder on his studies and not repeat the same mistake that Mr. Leonard made in his college days and it also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read better.

So when Mr. Leonard sees him in the hallway over and over again going to his study tables he notices that Paul seems like a motivated kid that wants to do well. So then Mr. Leonard thinks that he should ask Paul to start hurdling, and if he works hard in that just like he does in school, then maybe he can go off to college for hurdling but if he gets good grades he won't flunk out and that will make Mr. Leonard forget about his past a little."
20507,8,2,2,"The information concerning Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation. I believe this is because Paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading.

20580,8,2,2,"When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past, he is shocked at first. Mr.Leonard used to be a very successful track athlete. However, he didn't have the grades to continue doing well in college and he eventually lost his scholarship.     I think Paul relates to what Mr. Leonard went through so well is because Paul was basically going through the same thing. He had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read. Not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class, but he was extremely embarrassed. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to do anything since he believed that he wasn't that smart.      Mr. Leonard explains that he didn't have the resources when he was a child that Paul has now. All Mr. Leonard had was friends to help him, and unfortunately that didn't help his grades get better. He wants Paul to continue learning and to be succesful since he knows what its like to not be able to read.      Paul is affected greatly by the information he learns because he is going through the same thing. He relates to Mr. Leonard and in the end, that is why he decided that he would help him and get him to read."

Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard get back into track because he can tell Mr. Leonard really enjoyed it when he was younger."
20583,8,2,2,It turns out that Mr.Leonard had trouble reading just as Paul did. He flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for. He taught paul how to run track well and when Paul looked up Mr.Leonards information he found that he was just like him. It made Paul feel closer to Mr.Leonard and he helped him read the way he had helped him run track.
20584,8,0,2,The information it like how paul is struggling to read and that M. Leonard was going throught the same thing and that if he helped Paul then paul would help him read and overcome the embarrasment of not being able to read well.

When they first met Mr. Leonard knew his own past and found out that Paul could not read. Mr. Leonard wanted Paul to be like him in a way just be better.     The backround information that Paul found out made him realize that they are the same and that Mr. Leonard just wanted to help Paul with his future and not be a hall monitor but to be somthing more succesful.

Mr. Leonard states that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, because no school wanted a runner who could not read. Paul goes on to say that he knows Mr. Leonard's feelings of embarassment all to well, happening whenever he is called upon to read something aloud, or when he does not know an answer everyone else knows in class."
20591,8,1,1,"The story has an effect on Paul because he got the website URL from the high school track coach. And Paul went and looked at the website and seen some information he didn't know about Mr. Leonard, and wondered why he never told Paul.

It tells you why Mr. Leonard asked the kid for his name at the track, because he couldnt read it on his pass. Him flunking out of college also helped you understand that he wasn't very smart or else he would have graduated from college. Mr. Leonard likes helping Paul in his track because it is something he loves and he also wants to help Paul get better in something so he isnt always last for everything and it would boost Pauls' confidence."

The track coach had told him to visit a website, so Paul did and found out about Mr. Leonard. Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard had not mentioned it before and asked him what had happened. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard could not read, he took it upon himself to repay Mr. Leonard for what he had done for him."
20601,8,2,2,"Paul is encouraged. After training and learning that Mr. Leonard also could not read, he was encouraged to teach Mr. Leonard to read while Paul himself was being coached.

This enourages Paul to work hard, and makes him want to help Mr. Leonard the way Mr. Leonard helped him."
20607,8,2,2,Paul feels a connection to Mr. Leonard he states that in paragraph 45 sentence 1. They share a bound of having a hard time reading this connects them. Paul then steps up tp teach him how to read in paragraph 46.

However we also read that Mr.Leonard has a softer side to him which he does not show when he works as a hall monitor.  However as the story progresses we continue to show that Mr.Leonard cares about what happens to Paul.  At the end of the story we see the reason why Mr. Leonard cares about Paul.  Mr.Leonard does not want what happened to him also happen to Paul, as Mr.Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read just like Paul."
20615,8,2,2,"The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard is shocking. Paul had no clue that he was being coached by one of the greatest freshman college runners ever, as we come to find out in paragraph 38. It also gives Paul a way to help Mr. Leonard, becuase Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has troubles reading too. Paul starts training Mr. Leonard after he finds out all the information (paragraph 46), this brings the two closer together as friends, since Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard (paragraph 45)."

20626,8,2,1,"As Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past, he is a bit moved. He realizes though he is becoming good at hurdles, he needs to learn to read so he doesn't become like Mr. Leonard. He also realizes then that education comes before athletics. Paul can relate to all of this, because he is in that current situation. In 45 it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-- feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew. Paul then decides that Mr. Leonard has done him a favor, and has helped him reach a goal... to excel at something. 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.

20628,8,2,2,"The background information surprised Paul, but also made him curious as to why he did not continue to break records. When Paul found out Mr. Leonard also could not read, Paul knew the embarrassment Mr. Leonard felt so he wanted to help him learn to read."

20630,8,0,0,"The background information has more so of a good effect on Paul. From finding out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and couldn't read, probably made Paul feel as if he can do almost anything. It also probably made Paul want to read, because Mr. Leonard said, 'No other college wanted a runner who couldn't read.' So hopefully that put some type of effort into Paul."
20633,8,1,0,Mr.Leonard's background information has alot of impact on Paul mainly because Paul is facing the same problem. Mr. Leonard explains to him that he can be a good athlete but school is important to. Through the teachers past Paul has started to open his eyes.

He was trying to keep this all away from Paul so that he wouldn't start to think that he could also be kicked from school becuase nobody wants a 'runner who cant read'."

20642,8,2,2,"When Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in high school and in college but did poorly academicly it encouraged him to try his best. Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was one of the best hurdlers, but when he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read no other school wanted him, even though he was one of the best. This showed Paul that even though you could be one of the best at a sport it doesn't matter if you don't have the grades."

He soon found out that Mr. leonard was an amazing runner and even got a scholarship for it. the effect of learning Mr. Leonard was a great runner was that he really knew what he was doing and taught paul very well. Paul also learned that without education its hard to keep your dreams alive. If Mr. Leonard would have known to read he could have made even more records to beat.

Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is not just a hall monitor, in fact Mr. Leonard was a track star who broke records and recieved a college scholorship.

20697,8,2,2,"Paul sees that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete, but his athletic career was takin away from him because of his grades. Mr. Leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out of college. Paul is intrigued to hear this and it makes him want to do better as a student and as an athlete."
20699,8,1,1,I believe that the information that he learns about Mr. Leonard makes him have a very close connection with him. He realizes that his life is a lot like Mr. Leonard's life but that he has a chance to change his future.
20700,8,1,1,The effect the background information has on paul is that he will probly work harder on his reading so he wouldnt end up like Mr. Leonard and loose his scholarship.

If Mr. Leonard could read, but can be a track star, then Paul can work on his reading and become a track star. Mr. Leonard's history shows Pail what he can become."
20705,8,1,2,It gives Paul modivation to excel in the hurdles and also to help Mr. Leonard in areas he struggled with to.  The background information also gives Paul a feeling of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer everyone else knew.  He then realizes that Mr. Leonard is helping him to excel in something to make him feel important.
20706,8,1,1,"When Paul got background information on Mr. Leonard that effected Paul to, feel like he isn;t the only one that has a reading problem at school and couldnt read that well. And it also made him feel just like Mr. Leonard, because he was always pick lasted for a team so he also started training and got really good at sports so he wasnt chosed last anymore."

20709,8,1,1,"The background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by helping Paul recognize that Mr. Leonard never learned well and he needed Learning Centers. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but he was never an exceptional learner, through this, Paul gained the need to help Mr. Leonard learn."
20710,8,2,0,"The effects it has on Paul are sad, he didnt know that Mr. Leonard failed college. Mr. Leonard felt ashamed which made Paul want to do good."
20711,8,0,0,"Mr.Leonard and Paul both had something in common, they had a hard time reading. When Paul ran into Mr.Leonard in the hallway he asked for his pass and asked were he was going, Paul told Mr.Leonard he was going to learn to read because he couldnt.

20712,8,2,1,He is shocked and can't believe he was in college for hurdles. Also he didn't know why he didnt tell him before.' why didnt you tell me about this before?'
20713,8,0,0,"That Mr. Leonard was a Collage track super star and he broke records. It had a negative and a postive effect on Paul. It put him down that the man who had been helping him had not told him that he was a track star, but it also helped him when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it."
20714,8,2,2,"When Mr. Leonard told him about is college days paul wanted him to coach and train him, because he was a good coach to him. Paul felt the same when Mr. Leaonard told him about is past about no being able to read, so paul wanted to work hard to know how to read so he could go to college and run track."
20715,8,0,0,It makes Paul seem more able to read by using an adult who has trouble reading as another example. It also makes paul feel less inferior to Mr. Leonard. At the end of the story Paul makes a statement that begins the idea that Paul then helps Mr. Leonard with reading.
20717,8,1,1,"I believe that the background information Paul receives effects Paul in such a way that he feels inspired, encouraged and feels like the sky is his limit."
20718,8,2,2,"After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a major track star in college along with finding out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read, this inspired Paul to help Mr. Leonard. After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments, Paul thought of an idea. Paul was going to go help teach Mr. Leonard how to read since Mr. Leonard helped Paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic."
20719,8,2,2,"When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a champ track runner in his college days his becomes curious as to why he would quit if he had goen as far as setting records. He soon finds out that Mr. Leonard also could not read, just like Paul. This made Paul think that Mr. Leonard had helped him so now it's time to return a favor and tell him to 'C'mon, it's time to start his training' as he walks towards the school."
20720,8,1,1,He discovers that Mr.leonard is is just like he is. He relizes that not beening able to read is not a bad thing.
20721,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, but poor student. His college work was harder than high school work, so he lost his scolarship and dropped out. He said the coach did not want a runner that could not read."
20724,8,1,2,"When Paul found out that Mr.Leonard was a good track star and that he didn't go to college because he couldn't read, it reminded Paul of his self."
20725,8,2,1,Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was once very famous and good at track and he now understand that he wants Paul to follow in his footsteps in a sense. Mr. Leonard also is not good at school like Paul and wants to give Paul something that he can be good at and feels that track could be great for Paul.
20726,8,2,2,"The background information effects Paul because it makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. When Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard was a track star during college, by the URL given to him by the track coach, he acts suprised and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read."
20727,8,1,1,"Paul most likely now understands why Mr. Leonard is encouraging him to do the races, and wants him to go to college and graduate."
20728,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard was a star track runner and a horrible reader too.
20729,8,2,2,The background information about Mr.Leonard effects Paul by showing him and inspiring him with a story that is somewhat similar to his own. He knows that Mr.Leonard and himself have things incommon. They are both very bad readers and are good at running hurdles.
20730,8,1,1,"Paul understood better why Mr. Leonard took care of Paul. When Paul told Mr. Leonard he couldn't read, that was a sign right there that he was going to look after him and make him a star. With this back ground information, Paul felt more emotionally connected to Mr. Leonard because he went through the exact same things in his life. He felt like there was someone else out there, and this man was just trying to help Paul succeed at something."
20732,8,1,1,The background information that Mr. Leonard has on paul would make him feel sometype of sympathy for him. It would make him work harder and do better to get paul on track.
20733,8,2,2,The effect that background information has on Paul is that he now feels connected to Mr. Leonard because they both went through the same thing in not being able to read very good. Paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read.
20734,8,1,2,The information he finds about Mr. Leonard effects him alot because he relizes how much they are alike to eachother. They both have reading disabilities and he is trying to help him to get over that and not to affect him. Mr. Leonard gets him on the track and trains him because that is what he used to do and he wants to pass it on.
20735,8,2,2,Paul feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard when he finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read. I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well. Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.' Paul knows that this was the way that Mr. Leonard felt in high school and college.
20736,8,2,0,"He realizes the importance of working hard, learning to read and doing well in school. He handed the print out of the web page to Mr. Leonard and ask him what happened to him and Mr. Leonard told him his story. At that moment Paul realized that reading and graddes were important and Mr. Leonard didn't want him to suffer the same way he did."
20737,8,1,1,"I believe that gives Paul, the narrator, and the reader background because it shows us how important that education is but to Paul it's someone he can look at and understand. It gives a sence of companionship with others because he is slower at reading so are others. He is not alone. It also tells Paul that he can be good at things even if he is not so great at reading. That is why i believe that it gives background information."
20738,8,0,0,PAUL SEES THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU CANT DO SOMETHING RIGHT YOU CAN WORK HARD TO OVERCOME ANY OBSTACLE.
20739,8,1,1,Mr. Leonard asking the narrator has set Paul into the right frame of mind by knowing that life always has obstacles. Paul also relized that Mr. Leonard was always there to help and making Paul motivated to read. Everyone knows that reading is something you need to do not maybe want to do.
20740,8,1,0,Paul realized that even though your not good at one thing that you can't be good at something else. Just like when Paul talks about he knows the feeling of embarrassment when he was called upon to read aloud or when he did'nt know an anwser everyone else knew. Paul realized Mr. Leonard gave his time to help him excel at something and that its okay to not be good at something you just have to work at it harder.
20741,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard's past motivates Paul to succed and do his best in reading and hurrdiling as well, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at somethng. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'"
20742,8,0,1,The effect of this was to show that the hall monitor was not just a hall monitor but a record breaking track runner. Also so that the boy could think he could do the same the man did but this time graduate from college because he will be able to read and write.
20744,8,2,2,He finds out that Mr. Leonard and Paul both have problems reading so he feels better about him self.

20747,8,2,2,"Before learning of Mr. Leonard's background, Paul is ashamed by his inabiliy to read.  Once Mr. Leonard gets Paul running track and builds his confidence Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard use to be a track star.  When Paul questions Mr. Leonard about his previous track experience in college he learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college after his freshman year, due to reading and homework troubles.  Paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'  He also learns that just because he struggles in school doesn't mean he can't succeed with his dreams; he just has to work hard and have the right demeanor."
20748,8,1,1,"Paul actually wants to do this now that he knows Mr. Leonard was a hurdler himself and that he flunked out of college. An example from the story was when he thought to his self that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me . I knew them well, feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him."
20749,8,0,0,The efect that Mr. Leonards has on Paul is that he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard and he does not want to take the same route as Mr. Leonard and ruin the chances of having something good going for him.
20750,8,2,2,"When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past he is interested and wants to know more. Once Mr. Leonard explains what happens Paul understands. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' is what went through his mind. This encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read."
20751,8,2,2,"Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also couldn't read. His inability to read made life a lot more difficult for him; more difficult than it was for all of the other people that had gone to school with him. Paul, who also couldn't read, felt close to Mr. Leonard. He felt empathetic; he understood the hall monitor's emotions completely. He could identify with the embarrassment he felt.     Mr. Leonard had given Paul hope; he had shown him about hurdles and taught him how to jump over them efficiently and effectively. Eventually, Paul was able to join the track team. It had given him the chance to excel at something like never before. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, he felt as though he should give back. After the story ends, it's clear that Paul is helping to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he too could feel accomplished with himself."
20752,8,1,1,He was amazed by his accomplishments and wondered why even though he went to college he had problems with school work.
20753,8,0,0,M.r. Leonard feel s that paul is just like him in ways.  He couldnt read so he had to flunk out of college and he didnt want that to happen to paul.
20754,8,1,1,"It in a way gives him confirmation on why Mr.Leonard did the things that he did. And why he had taken a liking to Paul becasue when Mr.Leonard was younger he was alot like Paul, so i can only figure that it helpred Mr.Leonard move on from the past because he seen so much of himself in Paul."
20756,8,0,0,The effect on the background that he has on Paul was because on lines 3 and 4 Mr.Leonard talks and says 'Hey my friend where do you think you are going' Then Paul says the 'Learning Center' then he tells him that he can't read and later finds out that he excels in track later in the story.
20758,8,1,2,"Mr. Leonard was a big time runner in his college days, but was unable to learn anything while in college. As a result Mr. Leonard was thrown out of college and no other school would take him, because even though he was a good runner he wasn't well educated which was not tolerated. This is seen as a big incouragement for Paul, seeing as how he is blossoming into a good athlete and is also slowly getting his education, that he can accomplish things when he tries. Also Paul would be motivated to become better jumping and try to learn more to make Mr. Leonard proud of him and possibly accomplish what Leonard couldn't."
20759,8,2,2,"Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard, because Paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed. For example in the story the author stated ' I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when i idin't know an answer everyone else knew.' This statement shows Paul understood how Mr.Leonard felt. Therefore, Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard background."

Plus, when talking about how he is picked last in sports doesn't help his esteem either. But when learns of Mr. Leonard who had success in something even though he struggled in school, this may motivate Paul to want to excel at both the hurdles and in school and do what Mr. Leonard could not accomplish."

Paul works hard to and, gets help after school also, going to the learning center for help.      Mr. Leonard tells him how diffrent it was for him back when he was here Pauls age. They didnt have a learning center for him. Mr. Leonard had to go to his friends for help.     This showed Paul that he can do it if Mr. Leonard did. He will just have to work hard at school work and track."
20819,8,1,1,The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted him to try the hurdles and do well in the remedial reading program. Paul is then very empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and is probably going to try teach him.

20828,8,2,2,The background information about Mr Leonard is that he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals in college. What is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership. Why? Was because he didn't know how to read.
20830,8,2,2,that paul went to try how hurlding and Mr. leonard said to come on back tomorrow . Mr.leonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because Mr. leonard  was a good college track star.But Mr. leonard  could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college. So i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track

Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'"
20833,8,0,1,He realizes that he is the same way when it comes to school. He realizes also that he doesnt need to be booksmart to do things in life..

20836,8,2,2,The eefect the background information that paul found on Mr. Leonard was suprising to him that he was a trck star but yet whe he found out that he couldn't read he felt simpathy for him because in paragraph 45 and 46 he knows the embarassement that he feels of not knowing how to read and figures he can probiabily teach hi how to read.
20837,8,0,0,"That why would he be teaching him how to run the hurdles if he was so good and also to ask him why he is the hall monitor for the school, not a track star person."
20838,8,2,2,"Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought. When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul becomes more motivated. This is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team.

Paul seen that Mr. Leonard accomplished amazing things in life, and then come to find out he flunked out of college because he couldn't read, influenced Paul even more. Paul was improving more and more each week at running hurdles, so that made him work even harder at becoming a better reader knowing Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college because he couldn't read."

But since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school, he could not handle the more difficult college work. This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship.      Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard's emotions because he too, had difficulties wtih school work. At the end of the stroy, Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training. This implys that since Mr. Leonard has helped Paul with his running, that Paul will help Mr. Leonard to learn to read."

20875,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard's background information had a large effect on Paul. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals but flunked out of college because he could not read, and the school work was too challenging. No school would take a runner who couldn't read.

20954,8,2,2,"The information Paul learns on Mr. Leonard makes him wonder, and probably think of him as a role model.

20960,8,2,2,"The effect it has on Paul is that Mr. Leonard is just like him except he never learned how to read. Paul now knows he has a chance to make something of himself because he gets extra help, unlike Mr. Leonard."
20961,8,2,2,"From the way that Paul responded from the information about Mr. Leonard, he seemed suprised and kind of anrgy that Mr. Leonard didnt tell him. Once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell Paul, i think Paul understood more. I think now Paul has more of a connection with Mr. Leonard because they have something in common. Neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles. Towards the end of the story it makes them closer."
20962,8,0,0,"The effect Paul gets from reading about Mr. Leonard's background changes what he thought about him and answered a lot of questions for him. After paul knew why he flunked out of college, he took Mr. Leonard too the learning center."

Paul said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.' Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning center in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always to hard.' Paul said, 'But you went to college.' Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou.

He won many awards for track, but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read. After Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name, he knew he was going through the same thing.

21051,8,2,2,The effect that background information of Mr. Leonard has on paul is that he is not alone and the emotions were all too familiar to him. He knew them well.

It opens Paul's eyes and shows him that you have to be a good student first then you can be an athlete second. If you dont do it in the classroom then there is no point in even going out to try and do a sport. Mr. Leonard wants to live his dreams through of Paul because he wants Paul to do something that he was not capeable of doing.

The fact that Mr. Leonard's dream was shattered because couldn't read made Paul want to work hard so that he wouldn't have to fall in the same pattern as Mr. Leonard did when he was younger. He probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so Paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading.

21076,8,0,1,he sees that he is trying to get him to do something with his life he doesnt want to see him end up in the situation he was in. he knows the kid is trying to read and that he should do something else to motivate him. Leonardo is trying to be a roll modle and make a difference in teh kids life.
21078,8,0,0,It has a big effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard had the same problems he had when he was younger. In the story he shows Mr. Leonard what he found out about him and Mr. Leonard felt sad because he didn't want Paul to find out he couldn't read either.
21079,8,1,2,In this story when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard it opens up a bunch of different windows to him. Paul starts thinking about why he didn't run anymore. paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it and discovered Mr. Leonard was in the same shoes as Paul was. Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard was trying to help him.
21081,8,1,1,It helps him feel better knowing that he wasn't the only one with the same kind of reading problem.
21082,8,0,0,In highschool Lenard was like Paul not good at school work but a good athletic guy.
21083,8,2,0,He is overwhelmed with who he is talking to and that Mr. Leonard has the same problem he does by not bring able to read. When Paul said ' but you wnet to college.'
21084,8,1,0,The result of the background information is that Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who broke records for the 400 meter hurdles. The impact on Paul is tramendous because he relizes he has a collage all star working with him.
21085,8,0,0,doesnt make sense
21086,8,0,1,They both have the same problem not being able to read and do good in school.
21087,8,2,2,"Paul is surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals when he was a collage freshman. Then, he found out that he had flunked out of college, because he couldn't read. So, Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard."
21088,8,2,2,"In paragraph 5 lines 1-3 when Paul finds that Mr. Leonard couldn't read he knows the feeling: 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called pon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answere everyone else knew.' Then Paul realized he can help Mr. Leonard: ''C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.''"
21089,8,1,1,"The effect that the background information on Mr. Lenard has on the reader is inspiring to him. Paul finds out that Mr. Lenonard had the same struggles with reading and school work that he has. But he still was an exellent runner, making Paul want to keep at it so that he could be the same way. It was also inspiring because the teacher told him that he flunked out of college because he did not get good grades. That would make Paul want to work harder at his school work, so that the same thing would not happen to him."
21090,8,0,0,"Paul and Mr. Leonard are talkin one day after practice, and Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard went to a learning center when he was  in high school. Mr Leonard also was an amazing athlete. He did track and field and was very good at it."
21091,8,1,1,That he knows that Mr. Leonard is just like him.
21092,8,2,2,I think that at first Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler.  I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this.  Once Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a hard time reading too Paul begins to fell really empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
21093,8,2,2,"The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was inspiring. It was inspiring because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had gone/were going through the same thing. Mr. Leonard couldn't read but was excellent at sports, and Paul couldn't read but Mr. Leonard helped him excell at something so he wouldn't be a total 'loser.' Mr. Leonard said it sucked to be picked last in gym class so he tried to help Paul feel good about himself."
21095,8,0,0,That the kid didn't know about mr. leonard.That he ued to run track back in his days as a college student.
21097,8,1,0,It tells Paul that he can do anything if he just puts his mind to it and keeps trying he will succeed in anything and everything he trys.
21098,8,2,2,"Paul's opinion of Mr. Leonard changes for the better. Paul does not realize he is running for a former famous athlete and so has no reason to prove himself. When he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past and what happened to him, Paul is sympathetic and decides to teach him to read by saying, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard...It's time to start your training.'"
21099,8,1,2,"Paul was shocked that Mr.Leonard didnt tell him about his past. and when Mr.Leonard did he listened to see what he had to say. When Paul heard Mr. Leonard speak and tell his story, he heard the emotions in the his voice it made paul think about the times when he was in class and he got called out by the teacher to read a story or a book and he felt embrassed. An then he thought about what Mr Leonard was trying to do for him,so he thought about what he could do for Mr. Leonard."
21100,8,1,1,When Paul found this information he was shocked that he was hiding something so big like that from him. Paul was confused that a college level athleate was not good in school.
21101,8,1,1,The backround information about Mr. Leonard has a big effect on Paul because Paul understands why Mr. Leonard would want to coach him. It also makes Paul want to work harder for his coach because they have had alot of the same struggles. I also think Mr. Leonard would make Paul better than he was so Paul didnt have some of the same problems he did.
21103,8,2,1,Paul had not known about Mr. Leonard so he did as asked. Paul then was asked to go to the gym after school so he went and was tought how to jump hurtles really fast. He then goes to  the track and feild coach and shows him what he can do and the coach asked him to look up Mr. Leonard at a website to find out why he is so fast. Then he learns about a lot about Mr.Leonard  which I think inspired him to do his best and to help out his new found friend Mr. Leonard.
21104,8,0,0,Paul met Mr. Leonard when i started middle school. He was a hall monitor whose job it was to keep students moving along from one classroom to the next.
21105,8,2,2,Mr. Leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer. This made paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read.
21106,8,0,0,That infomation effected paul by feeling that he has been let down. He looks up to Mr. Grabowski and now sees a fall between the two.
21107,8,2,1,The backround information has a tremendous effect on Paul.  I say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete.  he also realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills.  Paul realizes the signicance of Mr. Leonards help.
21108,8,2,2,"The background infromation that Paul, the narrator, gets in this story is Mr. Leonard was an all-star track runner in high school.  He broke records and got scholarships.  Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard had a hard time comprihending  reading, like himself.  Mr. Leonard flunked college because he could not read well.     Paul knew what it was like for  Mr.Leonard becaue Paul could not read well, nor could he comprihend things easily."
21109,8,1,0,"The reader and Paul share the same mind frame. It states in the article, 'NO other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' They are both very dedicated to their athletics, however, when you cannot make grades you have to sarafice the things you love for the things you will need to know in the future. In the article it states 'I know them well...I didn't know the answer everyone else knew.' When it comes to education they are both slow at comphrending and understanding what the other students catch onto quicker."
21110,8,2,2,"The background information that Paul gathers about Mr. Leonard is that he use to be a college track star.  He found out that he wont the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that Mr. Leonard broke records.  Mr. Leonard then tells him, 'I was a good athlete...but not a good student.  We had no learning centers in our school.  I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'  It turns out that just like Paul, Mr. Leonard is a talented athlete, but did not recieve the resources that he needed to read.  Luckily, Paul does have those resources and talent, so hopefully he can make it farther than Mr. Leonard."
21111,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard found out Paul failed out of college because he could not read. When Mr. Leonard found out about this he said he was going to help him get help reading at a help center. By doing a backgroung check he is helping Paul out.
21112,8,2,2,It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard. But i also think that its gonna motivate Paul because he knows that Mr. Leonard really wants him to succeed at this sport. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read. He also said that he went to college but flunked out because it was too hard and how no college wanted a runner who couldnt read. So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard.
21114,8,0,0,He gets asked about it in the hallway.
21115,8,1,1,"Mr. Leonard shares with Paul that he was a hurderler back in the day. He was a great athlete and even broke records, but then Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his misfortune. Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Paul struggles greatly with reading so they both resemble eachother in that aspect. However Paul is in a learning center to get better at it. Mr. Leonard never had that opportunity."
21116,8,0,0,Paragraph 33 (sentence 1). He knows what he is doing.
21117,8,0,0,"Paul realizes that it does not matter wheather you are the best athlete in the world, colleges are looking for an athlete with good educational skills as well."
21119,8,2,2,"When Paul hears about how Mr. Leonard had a hard time in high school and collage, the narrator learns that Mr. leonard didn't have the type of resources to help him during his high school and collage days.  Paul felt much sympathy for Mr. Leonard, and decided to help him read."
21120,8,0,0,"The author uses many signs of foreshadowing in this story. The foreshadowing lead the reader to assume he is not educated well.       The author begins by introducing Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor. This suggests to the reader that he does not have an advanced education if he was just a hall monitor. When Mr. Leonard ask Paul what his name is in paragraph 24, it suggest that he either doesnt have a good memory or cannot read the pass. Another incident like this occurs when Paul shows Mr. Leonard his printout, and Mr. Leonard responds with a confused look.      The author's uses of foreshadowing allows the reader to get to know Mr. Leonard personally before the information is revealed to the main character Paul."
21122,8,2,2,"Things were different back then. Mr. Leonard was told that grades didnt matter, that he would have all the help he needed, but that was all a lie. He ended up losing his scholarship, and flunking out of college. No college wanted someone who couldn't read.       Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul. He was embarrassed when he was called on, or when he didnt know the answer because he couldn't read. All those feelings that Mr.Leonard had, Paul had the exact.       Mr.Leonard gave his time to help Paul succeed at something. After Paul realized what Me.Leonard was doing for him, he wanted to help Mr.Leonard out. Paul had then started training with Mr.Leonard."
21123,8,1,1,"it has a lot of effect on him because Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul over come obsticales, and knowing that Mr. Leonard was a national finalist made Paul wonder why he is helping him. then he basicla said that he doesnt want Paul to end up like him and not be able to read. so that probably encouraged {aul to try harder in school and learn to read"
21125,8,0,0,He is interested in it. Mr.Leonard broke lot of records and won a lot of races. Paul is lucky to have a coach like Mr.leonard.
21128,8,2,2,"It helps Paul know that he isn't the only one with this problem.  He realized that Mr. Leonard had felt the same thing that he (Paul) was feeling.  And, like how Mr. Leonard had helped him, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard."
21129,8,2,1,Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard. He feels the same way as Mr. Leonard did back when he was in high school. Hes going to train him on how to read and Mr. Leonard is goin to trian Paul how to do hurdles.
21130,8,1,1,"It has an effect on Paul because he completely understands what Mr. Leonard has gone through. In a way, he went through the same thing, and it states in the story that Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar. After learning Mr. Leonard's story, Paul now has someone that he can connect with. It also will now make him feel better about himself because he knows he is not the only one that does not achieve at everthing."
21132,8,1,1,"The background information on Mr. Leonard that Paul gets is only a way to motivate him more. He realizes he can be a good athlete even though the has trouble reading, because he has a good relationship with someone who went through the same thing."
21133,8,1,1,"The backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for Mr. Leonard, makes the narrator respect Mr. Leonard more. He knows Mr. Leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about, therefore he respects and follows his advice."
21134,8,0,0,"When Paul gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, it effects Paul because just like Leonard he can't read. But they both are good at hurdles, only bad thing is that Leonard coldn't get through college because he couldn't read. So that could have a huge effect on Paul because he doesn't know how to read."
21136,8,2,2,"When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners. It also determines Paul to do better in school and track."
21137,8,1,0,the information that paul learns about Mr. Leonared makes paul want to be better in the sport that he wants to be in and try out.
21138,8,2,2,"Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well.  Paul didn't understand how he got to college. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.  'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'"
21139,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard handed the paper back and looked at the ground, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke."
21140,8,0,1,It shows him you can be good at one thing but then at another you might not do so well. People are good at different things and noone can do everything. It kinda gives him the push to do what he loves to do!
21142,8,1,1,"'But you went to college', Paul seems as if he's supprised."
21144,8,1,1,It helps Paul find out who Mr. Leonard is. It also helps him understand how similar each of them are to each other.
21146,8,1,2,"Paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week.  he would leave english early to go to this program and every time Mr. Leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place.     When Mr. Leonard asked Paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym Paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework.  Once Paul got to the Gym he was asked by Mr. Leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles.  When he was finished he said that was aweful but Mr. Leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told Paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts.     I began to wonder why Mr. Leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look Mr. Leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help.       Paul began to realize that Mr. Leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically, since Paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles."
21147,8,2,2,"I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star track runner, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard had not already told him. Paul decided that he wanted to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read because afterall Mr. Leonard was helping him become a track runner. This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners."
21150,8,1,1,I  think paul knowing about Mr. leonard is a good thing it shuold make paul want to strive to trie harder so he doesnt end up in the same situation as Mr. Leonard.
21153,8,2,2,Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school. Paul is amazed when he learns that Mr. Leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman. Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
21154,8,2,2,"The high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that Leonard Grabowski was the person that was helping Paul with track. He also gives Paul a piece of paper with a website URL and tells him to do a search for Grabowski. This search pulls up information about Leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college. Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athelete, but he didn't know how to read, so he was a horrible student. This was touching to Paul because now he had someone else to relate to since Leonard didn't know how to read either. The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read."
21155,8,1,1,"The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is to try harder. When Paul showed Mr. Leonard that he knew about his times in college, Mr. Leonard told Paul how hard it was"
21156,8,0,1,paul feels just like mr. leonard felt in high school and college.
21157,8,2,2,"The information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard was sympathetic for him. Mr. Leonard, like Paul, had trouble reading. He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete. However, Mr. Leonard had no chance to receive any help with his reading issues and as such was not able to make it. At the end of the story, it's implied that Paul was going to help Mr. Leonard with his reading, just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul with his track prowess."
21158,8,2,2,It surprises him because Mr. Leonard never told him about how he was a college track star. It also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star.
21159,8,2,2,Paul understands now that the reason Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in High School. And realizes that they are a lot a like
21160,8,2,2,"Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star, and that he could not read. So, Paul believes that Mr. Leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school."
21161,8,2,2,after Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him.
21162,8,0,0,Paul wants to be like Mr. lenard now. So he askes Mr.lenard about his college track days.
21163,8,2,2,"Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals."
21164,8,2,2,"When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had broken records, in track and field, and had gone to college, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had never shared said information with him. When he asked Mr. Leonard about it, he discovered that, much like himself, Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning in school.After discovering that he had many things in common, academically, with Mr. Leonard, Paul decided that he would help Mr. Leonard much like Mr. Leonard had voluntarily helped him. He began 'training' Mr. Leonard to read well."
21165,8,0,0,Paul was going to help the teacher with things he needed help on.  he did this by walkin towards the school telling Mr. leonard it was time for his training.
21167,8,1,1,"When Paul discovered what Mr. Leonard had accomplished in his life, it gave him hope and courage to do the same. He was dtermined to be a better athlete. He wanted to prove he could be a pro athlete one day and make everyone proud of him."
21168,8,0,0,"Some of the effects in the storty was in the back grond information 'i was a good athlete,' he said softly ,' but not a good student. we had ne learning centers in our school. he relied on friends to help him get by."
21169,8,0,1,they are kinda alike in ways because Mr. Leonard cannot read well and neither can Paul.
21170,8,2,1,In the story Paul seemed suprised that Mr. leonard had been a former track runner and that he was good at the hurtles.
21171,8,0,0,Paul thinks the Mr. Leonard is just a hall moniter and paul does not know that Mr. Leonrad had anything to do with being a track star.
21172,8,2,2,The information that he finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks paul. When he finds out Mr. Leonard was a national champion he is astounded and later when he finds out the reason he quit is brcause he failed out of school he knows he needs to focus on his reading so the same thing does not happen to him.
21173,8,0,0,The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard makes Paul upset. Paul feels sorry curious about it. Paul pointed to the picture and asked Mr. Leonard about it.
21175,8,1,0,Mr. Leonards background information really makes Paul want to join track. Bcause this whole time he was putting his self down and not realizing that it only takes a little talent to become a star Mr. Leonard tells him that he didn't do to well in school and that was something that Paul had incommon with Mr. Leonard and when a teacher or coach can relate to a student or a team member that can bring out the best in a person and make them want to reach there goal faster which is what Paul ends up doing in the story.
21176,8,0,0,"Paul was more interested in his life. 'Well, what happened after that?'"
21177,8,0,0,Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard was a man that was mean a didn't really like kids.
21178,8,0,0,"In the story it shows that he is a nice guy. But he can be a little bit mean as well too. The effect of the background information is that he done track and he ran really really fast. But than he lost his scholarship for college. Due to his grades, even though they told him that they could help him with his grades. But he flunked out anyways."
21179,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard and Paul shared that they both have trouble reading in school and need help to be successful.
21180,8,1,1,"The effect that the background information has on Paul is that the information makes him very surprised. It motivates him to try harder though, because he struggles with school just like Mr.Leonard did. He knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt because he had been through the exact same things. Paul saw himself in Mr.Leonard, and it motivated him to change himself, along with Mr.Leonard again."
21181,8,0,1,"Mr. Leonard reflects who he is now. Paul is watching himself in him, that we should be better than he and make Mr. Leonard happy by giving hima job, to become his coach."
21182,8,0,1,Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college athlete and realises he has a great coach. This helps hm get a chance to work out with the highschool coach.
21183,8,1,1,Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him train and how important it is for him to work hard at getting better in reading.
21184,8,2,2,The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard has on Paul is that him and Mr. Leonard are very similar because they both had troubles with knowing how to read. Both also know how it feels to be embarrassed by the fact that they can not read.
21185,8,2,2,"After he goes on the website and finds the articles about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he never told him. So when he saw him next he asked him why he never told him about being one of the best on the track team. And he told him he couln't read, so that influenced Paul to teach Mr. Leonard how to read."
21186,8,0,0,he was a hurdler back then and he coudnt read
21187,8,2,2,"Mr. Leonard's background information inspires Paul. He finds out about Mr. Leonard winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college. Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read, nobody really helped him. Paul decides he's going to work harder in school and at track."
21188,8,2,2,"Paul probably didn't have that much respect for Mr. Leonard. I mean he had some because he never cried and complained, and Mr. Leonard reached out to him. Because of Mr. Leonard, Paul gained respect for himself, and didn't look so down on himself as much.      When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, Paul was shocked it seemed. Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard didn't tell everyone that he broke records. Paul learned that everyone has flaws in themselves, but it's their job to find what they are best at."
21189,8,1,0,"The information about Mr. Leomard gets the narrator wondering why if Mr. Leomard was such a good runner, then why is he a school monitor. It makes Paul mysterious about Mr. Leomard in a way also, because Mr. Leonard is too good of an athelete to be a hallway monitor."
21190,8,2,2,"The information that Paul obtained about Mr. Leonard probably confused and suprised Paul at the same time. He was most likely excited to learn that the person who has been training him was a record breaking college runner, but confused because Mr. Leonard never told him."
21193,8,1,1,"When Paul gets information about Mr, Leonard from his past he is shocked at first. He is more sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard, so he decides to help hi out by trainging him again like how he trained Paul. from the passage Paul says to Mr. leonard walking towards school ' its time to start your trainging."
21194,8,2,2,The backgroung information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel better about himself. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading.
21195,8,0,1,"Mr. Leonard is a quiet man about himself and doesn't mention himself or his past much throughout the story. The track coach gives Paul a website to go look up about Mr. Leonard. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a national 400 meter hurdle champion as a freshman in college. Paul wants to know why he didn't keep running throughout college, but then he finds out that Mr. Leonard did not know how to read that well himself and flunked out of college."
21196,8,1,2,"Paul did not know about Mr. Leonard being a track star in high school, so when the track coach gave Paul the website to check out, he asked Mr. leonard why he never told Paul he was a track star. Paul is glad to have a real athlete to help him, so now it's his turn to help Mr. leonard."
21197,8,1,0,"Paul says, 'the wnotions in Mr. Leonard's words wew all too familiar to me. i knew them well feelings of embarrassment."
21198,8,1,1,The background information startled paul when he herd about Mr. leonard
21200,8,0,0,"He starts to want to work out with the team after finding out, it has a great impact on his decision to continue with runing."
21202,8,0,0,Mr. Leanard was a hall monator in middle school. he was select few in a leraning program. He also worked with a tutor. He wroked with Mr. leonard with track.
21203,8,0,0,Mr. Leonard was a poor reader and the effect that background information has on Paul the emotions in Mr. Leonard words were all to familiar they knew them well.

21331,8,0,0,"You can be great at things but you should never give up on things that you struggle on, like the hurdle the first time Paul did them."
21332,8,2,2,Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
21333,8,2,2,Paul thinks of himself as not as good as evrybody else because he can't read well and at first didn't play any sports. He seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but didn't know how to read. This makes Paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete. This seems to make Paul feel better about himself and helps him decide to encourage Mr. Leonard to start learning to read.
21335,8,0,0,He went to college and was a big athlete and broke the records but Mr. Leonard didn't graduate because he couldn't read.
21336,8,1,1,"Well he learns that this weird hall guy or whatever is really a famous track runner and that he couldent read also. This in turn shows that if the narrator learns to read and tries hard that he can do the same, but without the flunking college thing. Also at the end akes him want to return the favor in a way for all the training that he gave him for some reading lessons i guess."
21337,8,2,2,The background information made Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor. Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it. Paul was surprised to hear how Mr. Leonard couldn't read. That he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read.
21338,8,2,2,Paul is very suprised that Mr.Leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star. Paul asked him 'why didn't you tell me about this'.
21339,8,2,2,When Paul found out that Mr. leonard did hurdles in collage  (38 ran 400 meter hurdles at the nationals) he was very enthused.
21340,8,0,0,"The background information about Mr. Leonard when he was a freshman in collage is similar to what is wrong with Paul. Paul has troubles reading and so does Mr. Leonard, Paul is a rare child that get chossen last in every sport.     Mr. Leonard was one of those kids in school because he couldnt read, so everyone choose him last in every sport. Mr. Leonard came cobncerned when he stopped Paul in the hallway at achool and asked him where he was going when Paul said the kearning center because i dont know how to read.     Both of them were tired of being choosen last in everything no matter what it was."
21342,8,0,1,he knows how it feels to be left out because of his inability to read or know the right questionHe relizes all of this when Mr. Leonard says that 'no school wanted a runner who couldn't read'
21343,8,1,1,"That Mr.Leonard is a good and talented athlete, but a very poor reader. Paul knows the feeling of not knowing how to read. Finding out about Mr. Leonard pushes Paul to read and work hard."
21346,8,2,1,"The background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard, helps motivate him.  It might make Paul, really work on his reading.  Even though Paul is still young, his running ablities may get him to also get a scholarship like Mr. Leonard, and for that he wouldn't want to lose his scholarship because of his grades either.  You can tell by that, from when he tells Mr. Leonard, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time you start your training.'"
21347,8,1,1,"When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete he questions what happend after that.  Mr. Leonard states, 'but not a good student' (42).  By saying this, Paul realizes that even if you are good at one thing, does not mean you shouldnt try anything else.  Mr. Leonard should have tried in school, and Paul should have been extending his boundries and comfort zone.  Also, it taught Paul that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses."
21348,8,0,0,"pau  is a trsck player in high school still, he's trynna get improvement on his track so he can win turnments, also he's a very fast runner to"
21349,8,2,2,I will write about why i feel that what paul found out about Mr. Leonard effects him in anyway.     I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach. When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past. Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects. They basically have the same issuses in their lifes.     Another reason why I feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to Mr. Leonard and paul can understand how he feels. Paul and Mr. Leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teach/help Mr. Leonard at reading also.
21350,8,1,1,It makes paul feel like he needs to help Mr. Leonard on his reading.
21351,8,0,0,he takes paul to different places to see what hes interested in and he found it by going out on the track.
21352,8,2,2,"The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner.  Because Paul, like Mr. Leonard, can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like Mr. Leonard did."
21353,8,1,2,"The background information had a great effect on Paul. It did because Paul had not realized who Mr. Leonard was and wanted to know more. When Mr. Leonard told him about his college struggles and his ability to not read well, Paul felt like he could help. In the end Mr. Leonard helped motivate Paul to try hurdling. Just like Paul helped motivate Mr. Leonard to learn to read for the first time. This effected Paul by helping him gain a new friend and trainer."
21354,8,1,1,Mr. Leonard's background information explained that he was a hall monitor whom everyone obeyed and never thought about anything else. This kind of reputation encouraged Paul to simply and blankly do as Mr. Leonard told him. It even encouraged Paul to obey Mr. Leonard on something as strange as being told to run hurdles on the track field.
21355,8,2,2,When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past he is encouraged because Mr. Leonard could not read but still broke records in track. Paul also want to return the kindness Mr. Leonard has shown him so Paul is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21356,8,0,1,The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it makes Paul more sensitive to why Mr. Leonard has been pushing and training him.
21358,8,2,2,"Throughout the story there are times when you suspect that Mr. Leonard is just like Paul. When they are at the track and Mr. Leonard asks for Pauls name, is a good sign that Mr. Leonard cannot read either. Mr. Leonard sees in Paul the likeness and commoness that they share. The effect it has on Paul is the support he gets from someone just like him. Paul can finally believe he can be great at something and that trying hard is not just a waste of time. Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul out, but the only way for him to help is if Paul lets him. Paul may not know exactly what Mr. Leonard went through right off the bat. But little by little Paul finds out and it motivates Paul to be a better person, athlete and harder worker."
21359,8,1,0,"The background information about Mr. Leonard, helps Paul believe that he can get better in track, knowing that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler."
21360,8,1,1,Paul was disapointed with Mr. Leonard. Paul showed this by saying 'Why didnt you tell me about this?' After Paul finds this out it incourages him more to jump hurdles and have him as a coach and train him. Paul wants to do better then Mr. Leonard.
21361,8,2,2,"Paul can't read and neither could Mr. Leonard. So when Mr. Leonard starts training Paul he doesn't tell him his story because he doesn't want him to discouraged and stop. When Paul does find out his story he asked about it. Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him. At the end of the story Paul takes Mr. Leonard to his reading class and says 'it's time to start your training.' Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, he returns the favor."
21364,8,2,2,"The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him. He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment. An example of how Paul knew those feelings, where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew. I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out, he wants to teach him how to read."
21366,8,0,0,"The information Paul found could have discourage him, as well as him feeling betraded an lied to by Mr. leonard.  Just by PAul printing something out an even showing it to him showed it bothered it alot."
21367,8,1,1,"Paul was shock to discover that his caoch, was the best runner in college his freshman year. Paul didnt know the reason why he didnt know about Mr. Leonard achievement. When paul discovered what happen he was sad.  Now paul wants to read more so he can be better and become just like Mr. Leonard."
21368,8,0,1,When Paul figures out what happen to Mr. Leonard when he was in high school and college showed him that they were both alike. He believed that Mr. Leonard was trying to show him that anything is possible.
21369,8,2,1,"He highly apriciates what Mr. Leonard has done for him. Now knowing Mr. Leonard has the same problem as he does, he wants to help him out just like Mr. Leonard helped him."
21370,8,2,1,"During the story when paul recieves the information about his coach Mr. Leonard he has mixed feelings he is some what shocked and paretially confused at first. This assumption is made through Paul asking questions about Mr.leonards college days. His feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question ' why didn't you tell me about this?'.     However, after Mr.leonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through. Paul ultimately feels like he owes Mr.Leonard , and deciedes to 'train' him ."
21371,8,1,2,"The effect that the background information that Paul is provided with is that Paul realizes that if he tries hard he can become successful. When the highschool coach gives Paul the opportunity to get information on Mr. Leonard, he takes it. Paul then confronts Mr. Leonard to ask why he did not go on to do greater things. Mr. Leonard then tells Paul that he had learning issues like him and encourgages Paul to try his best so he does not end up like Mr. Leonard."
21372,8,1,1,He weent and got his records and oictures and showed him which made him want to help Mr.Leonard.
21373,8,0,0,That you can do anything if you put your mind to it. And you dont have to be smart to do big things in life.
21376,8,0,0,It kind of shows him what kind of person Mr. Leonard was back then.
21378,8,1,2,The effect the background information has on Paul is to show that they are alike. Paul does not know how to read and struggles in class. By learning Mr. Leonards background information he sees that Mr. Leonard also had a hard time in school and could not read. It also helps him understands that he is not the only one and knows that Mr. Leonard understands how Paul feels.
21379,8,1,1,That he wanted to help Mr. Leonard with his challenge of reading.It said that no other school wanted a runner who could not read.So that  Mr. Lenord can go to college to complete his goal.
21382,8,1,1,He feels like it was too familiar for him and they went through the same stuff. Now he wants to help him out.
21383,8,1,1,When Paul learns about what Mr. Leonard used to be he is suprised. You know this by how he shows Mr. Leonard the picture and the printout that the track coach gave him in line 38. But he also feels more conected with him this is shown in line 45.
21384,8,1,1,It makes Paul and Mr. Loenard better friends because he was helping him train and he was being very good to him and Paul was being good and progressing very well and when he found out about his trainer he wanted to help him just like his trainer helped him.
21385,8,0,0,Paul was a great athlete but he cound not read. Paul didnt know who Mr. Leonard was and Mr. Leonard liked that because he was embarresed of not being able to read. when he did find out paul didnt care until he started coaching him and helping him with his sport.
21387,8,2,2,"When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past he's at first surprised and wonders why this was kept from him all this time and why he would go through all the trouble to teach him. Once he learns that he flunked college because he couldnt read well, that encourged Paul to work harder at reading and teach Mr.Leonard how to read better just like he taught Paul to be a athlete."
21388,8,1,2,"Once Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's background, it makes him feel stronger. he realizes that he is not the only one who could not read, he sees that he is not alone. That information pushed Paul to strive for the better, in the hurdles and at reading. He sees that he has more oppurtunities than Mr. Leonard did, and decideds to take advantage of them, for the better."
21389,8,1,1,"Paul understand how Mr. Leonard feels because of Paul own experiences he is going through in his life. Paul experiences some of the feeling with Mr, Leonard because when he was in class with the others students he would have feel bad when the teacher calls on him, but he didn't know the answer to the question."
21391,8,1,1,"The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard makes him want to help Mr. Leonard, because he helped him."
21393,8,0,0,"Because he want's him to find out everything about track and field. and then he find's out Mr. Leonard was a track and field runner and he broke records in college. As a freshman and then he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, and no one wanted a runner that couldn't read. So he gave up so he wanted to help paul and so paul wouldn't be like Mr. Leonard when he was a kid so he started training paul after school and getting him in shape for track and field. so he can be on the team just like him back in the day."
21396,8,2,2,In what Paul says in paragraph 35 we can infer that he is amazed that Mr. Leonard was a track star in high school and confused that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him. It also probably suprised him that Mr. Leonard didn't become famous because he couldn't read because earlier in the story he was confused because Mr. Leonard asked his name after seeing his hall pass on multiple occasions.
21397,8,2,2,Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star that broke many records. Then a while later Paul has a conversation with him. Mr. Leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he wasn't a good student. This relates to Paul because he can't read that well.
21398,8,2,2,Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard. He knew how it felt not to read. He wanted to help Mr. Leonard since he helped him.
21399,8,0,0,"Mr.Leonard began walking back toward the school,then turned and asked"
21400,8,1,1,I think it motivated Paul to do better in school and do be the best at track that he could be.
21401,8,0,0,"Paul thinks that sense Mr. Leonard trained him to become a good reader that he thinks he should go to college and graduate college unlike Mr. Leonard who flunked out because he couldnt read. Paul was going to the learning center to learn how to read, so Mr. Leonard seen he was trying and it made him proud,just because you cant read dont mean you cant succeed in life."
21402,8,1,1,ITS SURPRISES HIM A LOT. WHEN HE IS ASKING MR. LEONARD WHY WAS HE HIDING THAT FROM HIM
21403,8,2,2,"Paul is embarrassed by his reading problems but, later he finds out that Mr. Leonard and him are not so different because in Mr. Leonard's past life as a hurdler he struggled with reading too."
21404,8,0,2,"After Paul learns Mr. Leonard's history, Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was motivating him to push harder for his goals. Mr. Leonard was not able to read which changed his entire life. He is concerned for Paul. Paul then understands that he must overcome his weakness in reading because he doesn't want to give up like Mr. Leonard had."
21405,8,0,0,From the stroy Paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading. In a simmular background Mr. Leonard was a excelling Track athlete in the 400 meter hurdels. From Mr. Leonard's past he dosen't whant to have someone repeating his failures.
21406,8,2,2,The effect the background information has on Paul is understanding. Paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read. And if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunity's that will never come again. Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he isn't embarrassed about not being able to read for the rest of his life.
21408,8,0,0,"Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in school, but not a great student. Mr. Leonard struggled when it came to school and didn't have the help he needed to be a better student. His friends helped him out a little, but once he got to college everything got harder. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading, just like Paul. Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school. Just because Paul has a har time reading, doesn't mean he cannot be sucessful in sports. Paul is lucky enough to have tutors, and someday Paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out Mr. Leonard's dream."
21409,8,1,1,It shows Paul a different side of life. Also its helps motivate him to keep goin. It make s him want to help Mr.Leonard. Plus its something that Paul understands because in a sense he is kind of like MR.leonard
21410,8,1,1,The background information that Paul recieves helps him to see why Mr. Leonard was helping him and pushing him.
21412,8,2,2,"The background information Mr. Leonard told Paul took an effect on him. Paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship, like Mr. Leonard, but graduate. It's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters."
21413,8,0,0,"He questions him about it, he wants to know why he stoped."
21414,8,2,2,"When he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes. He realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him. Yet then he finds out that he cant read, this discourages him yet brings him to the conclusion that since Mr.Leonard taught him well its time to teach him something."
21415,8,2,1,"The background information on Mr. Leonard had a motivating effect on Paul, because Mr. Leonard had the same problem as Paul, who was also a great runner."
21416,8,0,0,"The effect that the background information has on Paul is that whether you are a bad reader or you feel like an outcast, you can always be a success in something."
21417,8,0,0,The information has an effect on paul because he has a way of learning how to read and learning things as Mr. Leonard dont no how to do some of the stuff that they have got to do.
21418,8,1,1,"When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past it made him want to work harder in hurdling and in his efforts for reading. He said that Mr. Leonard's emotions were familiar to him, so now he will work hard to help himself and Leonard"
21419,8,2,1,He waas really surprized that Mr.Leonard was a collage athlete and he broke records.When Mr.Leonard told Paul that he wasnt a good reader he couldnt under satnd why not untill Mr.Leonard explaned to him the situation that the scoots told him not to worry about the grades just worry about the sport and he failed his classes and Mr.Leonard had to drop out. Mr.Leonard wants to set a goal for Paqul to achevie.
21423,8,1,2,"Before Paul finds the background information over Mr. Leonard, he doesn't really think twice about the fact that he could be more than a janitor. After he finds it, though, he feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. The parallel at the end of the story between Mr. Leonard helping out Paul in the beginning and Paul helping him in return shows the reader the impact Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul."
21425,8,1,0,"he knew how he felt because he was in the same situation, he helped him get help at the learning center."
21426,8,2,2,paul feels that he can relate to the janator and is glad to know that he is not the only one with the problem of not being able to read verry well
21427,8,0,0,The background information makes Paul curious at first. It makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past. It made him question Mr. Leonard about why he didn't share the information. It also makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't make it any farther with the sport. It brought up the conversation between the two of them when Paul found out about the whole story behind Mr. Leonards track career.
21428,8,0,0,That Mr. Lenoard was a godo athlete but he didnt do good in school so he got fluncked and he wants to help the narator so that he can do good in school and have a succesful careere.
21429,8,1,1,"After hearing the story Mr. Leonard has to say about his past, the narrator feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and understands what he went, and still is , going through. The backgrrround story really brought them closer together because it made the narrrator feel like Mr. Leonard isn't so much of a stranger, but someone a lot like him."
21430,8,2,2,"That Paul is totally suprised about the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard being a track star in college and being one of the best. Thats been training him on the track everyday. From going to the learnign center during the week and then having Mr. Leonard teach him how to hurtle and train him. Then Mr. leonard tells him why he drops out of college from not knowing how to read and that you are lucky that you have a learning center. Then Paul looks at Mr. Leonard and says you have training to do."
21431,8,0,0,"He finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, and wonders why he didn't tell him about it. In the story he asks Mr. Leonard, 'why didn't you tell me about this?'"
21432,8,2,2,"During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he went to college and ran hurdles. But he also finds out that Mr. Leonard didn't do well in school. So Paul can kind of relate to this. I think that this helps Paul realize that he could be good at something too."
21433,8,2,2,He figures out that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then Mr. Leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read so Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard took such interest in him after school. Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21434,8,2,2,"The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard makes him suspicious of why Mr. Leonard did not tell Paul about his past.  Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star.  After finding the background information about Mr. Leonard Paul says to him, 'Why didn't you tell me about this? You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments.  Surprisingly, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized.  Paul discovers one of Mr. Leonards most emabarassing secrets, that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college.  Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard asked him his name that first day at the track; he was never able to read Paul's name on his hall pass.  After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, it motivates Paul to work even harder at school and at track.  It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.  Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything."
21435,8,2,2,In the story Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that he broke records. He also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner. When Paul finds out this information it gives him motivation to try harder and to work at things that do not always come easy to everyone. This motivates Paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the Learning Center. It also gives him the motivation to tutor Mr. Leonard at the end of the story. He thinks that it is time for Mr. Leonard to learn how to read.
21438,8,2,2,"Paul was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in college. That information motivated Paul to be a better hurdler. It made the bond that Paul and Mr. Leonard shared, stronger."
21439,8,2,1,Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is just like him.  When Paul sees who Mr. Leonard really is he is shocked.  'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles ar the nationals.  Your broke records.'  Paul now sees that Mr. Lenard did know what he was talking about when he was teaching him to jump hurdles.
21440,8,2,2,Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can't read just like himself. So Paul now understands why Mr. L told him to meet him after school. Paul then realizes what he could do for Mr. L.
21442,8,2,2,"At the beginning of the story, Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble. Then, he helps Paul learn the hurdles, and Paul begins to like him. When the track coach told Paul to search for Mr. Leonard on the internet, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard has a learning disability just like he does. This helps Paul to know that he isn't the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read. Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something. In return, Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read."
21443,8,2,2,"The information connects Paul with Mr. Leonard and shows how they are similar like the 'feelings of embarrassment'.It also makes him realize that he helped him excel at something out of his own time, which makes Paul want to help him read."
21446,8,2,2,Paul is amazed at Mr. Leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner. Paul also finds out about Mr. Leonards weakness as a reader and wants to help him strengethen that weakness as Mr. Leonard helped Paul in his weakness for track.
21447,8,0,0,Paul found out that Mr.Leonard broke records as a college freshmen and even went to nationals
21448,8,2,2,"Paul is happy an shocked at the same time. He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track star. Mr. Leonard trained Paul, so now Paul wants to train Mr. Leonard to read."
21449,8,2,2,"When the track caoch gives Paul the URL and tells him too look up Mr. Leonard he was shocked to find out that he broke alot of records and was really good. When Mr. Leonard told Paul the reson why he can't do it anymore is because he didn't know how to read and flunked out of college, it reminded Paul of himself because he didn't know how to read and goes to a tutor. 'Hey  my friend, where do you think your going?' 'learning center' 'why?' because I don't know how to read.'"
21452,8,0,0,The boy who wanted to join the track team is or could be the best. It could be some one else thou. we will never know for shore.
21453,8,2,2,"The background information causes Paul to feel closer to Mr. Leonard. For example, the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to Mr. Leonard. Also, Paul now has something else in common with Mr. Leonard, a difficulty reading. The background information also allows Paul to return Mr. Leonard's favor of teaching him to run track. Paul can now teach Mr. Leonard how to read and do well in school."
21454,8,2,2,"The effect that Paul recieved from getting information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul had felt the same exact way. Paul knew what he was talking about. Since Mr. Leonard had helped him greatly with the hurdles, he felt as if he should help him how to read. So Paul took him down to the learning center so Mr. Leonard could know how to read."
21455,8,0,0,he sees that mr. leonard used to be a track star
21456,8,0,0,Getting Mr.Leonard's information has a big effect on Paul.
21457,8,2,1,"Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler runner, and became inspired after Mr. Leonard told him he had to lose his scholarship and flunk out because he couldn't read. Paul could relate to him by remembering his feelings of embarrassment when he was called on to read and didn't know an answer everyone else knew."
21458,8,2,2,"The narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track. When he realized that Mr. Leonard had great success in the 400 meter hurdles, but couldn't read, Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had the same experience he was having. Paul then wanted to help Mr. Leonard with reading in the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with track."
21459,8,2,2,"The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful. Because Mr. Leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read, he wanted Paul to possess the skills he had in running, but he also wanted Paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself. Since Paul knows that now, he believes you should pay Mr. Leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at, which is reading."
21460,8,0,0,the backgroung infromation is about him being a hall  monotor and enjoying it but when thr track comes up he is a really good high school herdeler and knows what he is doing with paul and the coach and he has a good hurdiling future ahead of him.
21461,8,2,2,"I think that the back ground information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard makes Paul happy. He now feels like he fits in with Mr. Leonard since they share the same problem.
