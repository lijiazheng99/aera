'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard, after Mr. Leonard helped him.      They helped each other in this story, because they seen a bit of themselves in the other. Mr. Leonard knew that Paul couldn't read, so he helped him learn how to jump hurdles, knowing that could symbolize facing the problem head on, and jumping over it. Passing.  Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, and so he helped him. They bonded over their experiences.",2
21856,8,"Paul feels as if he and Mr. Leonard are in the same boat. They both have a hard time reading, and are good at running hurdles. Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard with reading, while Mr. Leonard helps him with running hurdles.",2
21857,8,"Paul was disappointed at first that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past hurdles experience. However, after talking with Mr. Leonard he understands completely what he had went through and how hard it was for Mr. Leonard to keep up in school. Paul knew all too well about that. Paul shows sympathy and understanding and decides to do something for Mr. Leonard by helping him train with hurdles again. It also instills motivation in Paul to learn to read and do well in school so that he may one day go to college and do both hurdles and schoolwork.",1
21858,8,The background information wasa conection between the two because the both hav a harder time with school.,1
21859,8,The backround infomation tells Paul that Mr. Leonard is good at the sport and he wants him to succeed. The backround infomation also tells Paul that Mr. Leomard needs help with something because he is shy about why he stopped track. When Paul found out that he could not read Paul took him down to remedation.,0
21860,8,Cause you should alwways do a background check.,0
21861,8,The background information Paul got about Mr.Leonard effects him. When Paul researched him he found out he won the 400 meter. Paul wanted to know what happened and Mr. Leonard told him he got kicked  out of high school because he could'nt read and Paul knows how that feels. Mr.Leonard wants Paul to succeed an make it like he didn't,2
21862,8,"He realizes that Mr. Leonard knows how he feels, he was the same way. It also shows him that he can do things, just like hurdling. You have to overcome them. I also think that Paul will continue to learn his reading and help Mr. Leonard, too.",2
21863,8,"Paul finds out from the track coach that Mr. Leonard was once a national champion in college. He then confronts Mr. Leonard about it and gets the whole story. Mr. Leonard confesses that he was a bad student and ended up flunking out of college. This helps Paul realize that even though he's good at hurdles, he needs to stay on top of his school work.",0
21864,8,"The background information about Mr. Leonard effected paul in many ways. Paul realized that Mr. Leonard was a lot like him. Mr. Leonard could not read either when he was about his age and, he looked at Paul as himself and chose to not let the same thing happen to Paul.",2
21865,8,It relates Paul to Mr. Leonard and he understands why he wanted to help him.,1
21866,8,"When Paul finds the background information about Mr. Leonard, he becomes more confident about his not being able to read, and about running hurdles in track. Mr. Leonard explains how he was the best runner at his college and that he broke records, but he could not read, so he flunked out of college. Mr. Leonard felt sympathy for Paul when he first stopped him in the hallway because they were in the same situation. Because they have this in common and because Mr. Leonard helps Paul, Paul wants to help him at his faults, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul helps out Mr. Leonard by helping him learn how to read in exchange for Mr. Leonard teaching Paul how to run and jump hurdles.",2
21867,8,Paul was shocked that Mr.Leonard was a track star and was curious why he didnt tell him. Paul asked Mr.Leanard why he didn't continue. When Mr.Leonard told him that his grades weren't great then Paul felt more motivated.,2
21868,8,It shows him what might happen if he does not try to push himself in his academics.,0
21869,8,he diden't know about it he was shocked. But he asked him about it.,1
21870,8,"'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' That right there would automatically influence me. Paul may not have been a very good reader, but he sure did want to make Mr. Leonard proud. So he joined the track team.",2
21871,8,At first Paul did not really know why Mr. Leonard was doing this and Paul only did it because he was use to doing what Mr. Leonard had told him. Then when Mr. Leonard finally breaks down and tells Paul what happened to him and all his story Paul feels like he should bejust like Mr. Leonard only difference is that paul will be able to read and do studies. Then Paul will be able to get into college and actually get and education and do track at the same time.      Paul felt bad for Mr. Leonard and ecided to be like him and do wehat he says because now that he knows that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he was really good means that paul will believe in Mr. Leonard more and do everthing that he says. Even though he already listened to ehat he said usually it will just make him feel more comforting around him.,2
21872,8,Paul is a little confused by the fact that Mr. Leonard had never told him of his past and he had wondered why he had not told him.  When Mr. Leonard tells him why he had failed out of college and then Paul returns the help Mr. Leonard gave him by teaching him how to read.,0
21873,8,The effect the background information has on Paul is that he feels more connected with Mr. Leonard.,1
21874,8,He is surprised that he had not known how famous Mr. Leonard had been and confused as to why he had not told him. Mr. Leonard's story had a strong affect on Paul because it was very similar to his.,1
21875,8,"When Paul discovered the background information, it made him realize what a priveldge it was that he was able to be trained by him. Also, it gave him confidence to go work out with the high school track team. By knowing that the man who trained him broke national records, he was given confidence pertaining to his own skills.",2
21876,8,The effect that it had was question. The reson for that is he wondered why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about it.,0
21877,8,I think that all the background history that Paul finds out about Mr.Lenoard is a big change for him and that he needs to learn more about him to feel comfortable to play the sport that he is being trained in and that Mr.Lenoard is feeling bad because he didn't let Paul know ahead of time what type of background he had.,0
21878,8,/he was very exited about finding out that he was being coached by somebody who all of these great things,0
21879,8,Paul goes to get help to learn how to read.Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he can't read very well.,0
21880,8,"Paul has kind of the same thing going on in his life.  After he finds out about Mr. Leonards background, he wants to help him.",1
21881,8,When he got the background information on Paul he was shocked that he failed out of collage. But he didnt want to say anything to harm him in anyway for failing.  THey both helped each other threw there hard times.,2
21882,8,The effect that it has on Paul is that he wants to help Mr. Leonard out since he helped Paul out.,1
21883,8,The background information effects Paul in many ways. Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a great man and Paul saw that Mr. Leonard helped him achieve something and he wants to do the same. Paul takes Mr. Leonard's college past life and realizes he is better then that and helps him learn to read.,2
21884,8,"This effects Paul in a good way. It's almost like Mr. Leonard's story inspires Paul, he was impressed. The quote from the article, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records,' makes it sound as though Paul is indeed impressed.      Paul is concerned what happened to Mr. Leonard's career in running. 'Well, what happened after that,' this quote is an example of his concern. As soon as Mr. Leonard explains to Paul that he could not read, Paul was in shock. 'But you went to college,' he couldn't believe Mr. Leonard could not read either.",2
21885,8,It effects Paul because Paul has trouble reading and realizes that him and Mr. Leonard have this in common. He also may have realized that just because he is bad at reading doesn't mean he can't be good at other things.,2
21886,8,When Paul found out about him in track he sounded confused and wanted to know why he stopped running. Then when he found out it sounded to me that he was disapointed because he didnt finish school but he was understanding and wanted to help him by teaching how to read and to be smarter.,2
21887,8,In the story the reader gets background information about Mr. Lenard the information that Paul discovers effects him in a very positive way. He finds out that with practice and hard work you can do anything that you set your mind to. With the experiences that Mr. Lenard went through Paul can learn from the mistakes that he made and he can be more sucessful. Mr. Lenard wants Paul to not drop out of college and also be a sucessful track runner. Mr. Lenard wants the best for Paul and his only intentions is to make him more sucessful.,2
21888,8,Paul was upset because Mr. Leonard never told him he went to college and broke the record. The background effected Paul because he did not know what he could do for Mr. Leonard.He does now because he can start to train him as he did for Paul.,1
21889,8,The effect of the background information has on Paul is that Mr. Leonard was once him before not knowing how to read but was a good athlete.So he trained him to become good in track so he returned the favor and did something for him.,0
21890,8,Learning the information about Mr. leonard is so that Paul can have a deeper understanding of why he is being instructed to do the running.,1
21891,8,"Paul does research on Leonard and finds out all that stuff about how he ran the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke all these records. What it did was not only suprise him but it also inspired him because Mr. Leonard couldn't read either, so just because Paul can't read doesn't mean he still can't succeed.",2
21892,8,"The effect that the background information Paul got from Mr. Leonard shocked him. It shocked him because Paul would have thought that because Mr. loenard was a exellent track runner, he would have went and graduated from college.",1
21893,8,"He is puzzled, he wants to know what happened to Mr. Leonard after he broke the records. He asked 'well what happened after that.'",0
21894,8,The background information that Pual found on Mr.Leonard made him even work harder. The reason why because Mr. Leonard was a great track star back when he was in college and it made him wanna be track star.,1
21895,8,"The narrator started looking up to Mr. Leonard, because he was going through the same learning disablity he was fighting. The narator noticed that Mr. Leonard could not read very well when Mr. Leonard asked his name when he checks his hall pass twice a week.",0
21896,8,After Mr. Leonard told paul his story about college and his low skill on education Paul realized that Mr. Leonards words and speech were all too familiar to him. Paul Knew how Mr.Leonard felt about his feelings and embaressment when he had to read out loud.,2
21897,8,Paul can really relate to Mr. leonard after he learns about his history and finds out that he could not read very well when he was a kid. Paul also is very impressed with the achievemnets that Mr. Leonard achieved when he was in college. Pau realizes that he can help Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read just like Mr. Leonard taught Paul to jump hurdles.I think that the similarity in each one of the characters pasts will help them to become closer together and form a good friendship with each other.,2
21898,8,Pual is suprized that Mr. Leonard was a kid is track. Also that he made it to calloge running track for them. Pual was also surprized he won the 400 as a freshman.,1
21899,8,"Paul feels sorry for him and wants to help.  At the end of the story, he starts walking back to the school to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.  Paul could also relate to him since he had been bad at sports and Mr. Leonard was bad at reading.",2

The effect that this information has on Paul is that it shows him that although you can't read or have learning disabilities, that doesn't stop you from achieveing big goals in life. The mistakes Mr. Leonard had made influenced Paul to want to strive for what he wanted. It made him stronger inside.",2
21902,8,"This background information surprised Paul. He thought that Mr.Leonard was just a hall monitor that kept students moving along to class. When he found out about Mr.Leonard's past, he felt sort of a connection with him. In paragraph 45, Paul said that he knew how Mr.Leonard felt because he was going through the same thing.",1
21903,8,The backround information makes Paul a better student because he asks for help with the learning center.,0
21904,8,It makes Paul curious to why Mr. Leonard never told him he use to be a hurdler since he's teaching Paul to hurdle. The after Leonard tells him his story then Paul relates to it and find they are alike.,1
21905,8,"The effect that the background information has on Paul, is that Paul could understand Mr. Leonard's point of view on things. He went to the learning center as well as Paul. He told Paul that he was a good athlete but had to work hard in high school to get good grades. Mr. Leonard felt emabarrassed telling Paul but Paul could tell the sadness because it was all too familiar to him. Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul. So that's just what he did.",1
21906,8,Mr. Leonard's story effects Paul because Paul is a poor reader himself and just found out that a teacher couldnt stay in college because he couldnt read either and realizes that without the learning center he could have ended up just like Mr. Leonard.

21909,8,"It reminds him how he has his problem with being an acedemic star, but a terrible athlete, because Mr. Leonard was a star athelete, but an academic failure. He knows how that embarassing feeling feels. Being good at one thing but an embarassment to the other.",0

21911,8,"After learning about the background information the coach told Paul to look up I could imagine he was feeling mixed emotions. At first when Paul adresses Leonard for the first time he is hesitant and confused because he wasnt sure why Leonard would keep this from him. However, once Leonard and Paul talked about it briefly Paul's emotions switched from confused to astounded by how Leonard, the hall monitor, broke records in the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman.",1
21912,8,Paul is excited knowing that Mr. Leonard was a top athlete who did so many amazing things like braking records at a college level.,0
21913,8,It dosent have that much effect on him. He is surprised that he had a past like his.,1
21914,8,He learned that Mr. Leonard was really good at track and feild during high school. He wanted to know why he stopped. Mr. Leonard didn't want to tell Paul about it so he wouldn't give up. 'I pulled the printout I'd downloaded the night before from my pocket. 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'' (35). He wanted Paul to do the best he could and not get worried about messing up.,0

But when Paul found out about what Mr. Leonard used to be and how Mr. Leonard couldn't read just like Paul and that made Paul feel happy that Mr. Leonard helped him excel at something and let him know it's okay to not be able to read but keep working hard so you can stay in college.,1
21918,8,It teaches Paul an important lesson that working hard in school is imortant. It tells him that if you are not properly educated then you will be held back from doing what you want to do in the future. When the coach tells the kid he flunked out of college this tells Paul the importance of knowledge.,1
21919,8,Paul knew how Mr. Leonard felt he is the same way in school he felt embarrassed when he was asked to read or answer a question that he didnt know the answer to so paul felt like he should help Mr. Leonard sience Mr. Leonard helped him.,1

22240,8,"I think that Paul was surprised and embarassed all at once.  Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard was helping him because he was just like him in school, except did the right thing.  Mr. Leonard didn't try at school like Paul or didn't get help from teachers like Paul seeked to do.  I think Paul was also surprised that Mr. Leonard had broken records when he said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 mete hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  I think paul didn't see this coming.  He was shocked that he was being trained by someone who had accompished such amazing tasks.",2

22278,8,"Mr. Leonard embodies the once great, old mentor cliche. Because Paul is unaware of Mr. Leonard's past, and is used to following his orders, Paul is willing to try the things Mr. Leonard confronts him with. As stated in paragraph one, the last sentence, 'everyone complied.' No one questioned Mr. Leonard, and therefore his past was never questioned.     When Mr. Leonard becomes empathetic towards Paul, it changes things. When you become used to someone, it becomes easier to question and learn about them. Paragraph eight foreshadows this relationship when it says the Mr. Leonard's 'gaze softened' towards Paul.     Not knowing about Mr. Leonard really has as much effect in the early stages of their acquaintance as much as later learning changes their relationship. When the coach writes out a web address and tells Paul, 'Visit this site. Do a search for 'Grabowski,'' it precludes the notion that Mr. Leonard's life was dull and without bother for question. Rather, it changes the accepted lack of knowledge to a pursuit of mystery.     Finally, when Paul learns of the reading impairment that he shares with the old janitor, the relationship is solidified because they have a common ground. Once the existance of this common ground is justified, that is, once Paul realizes that there is a common place between them, Leonard Grabowski becomes a much less abstract and more relateable figure.
