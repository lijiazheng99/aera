28105,10,"white ::  white is the best color because it keeps it v ery cool, lighter colores like white reflex the sun lite that makes it mo re cool and darker coolors like black absord that makes it more hot",1
28106,10,light gray :: i picked light gray becuase i thought i didnt want the dog to be to hot in there by having it black or dark gray but t hen again i didnt want the dig to have white just in case he wont get to cold so i picked light gray so he/she will feel just right,1
28107,10,"white :: I would choose White colored paint because the dog house would be cooler according to the results in the expiriment where black was for the first trial , 54(DEG)C, then for the last trial also 54(DEG)C. Where as White at its first trial got 42(DEG)C and 41(DEG)C for its last trial",2
28108,10,"light gray ::  Since the doghouse will have a living being in it, the temperature should be comfortable for the dog. 53(DEG) C is very, very warm and would make a dog uncomfortable, especially on a warm su mmer day. But, 41(DEG) C is too cold for a dog in the winter time, as this would be a year-round house for the dog. So, 45(DEG) C would be less hot in the summer, and more warm in the winter, which is just perfect for the dog.",2
28109,10,white :: it wont exorb that much heat so it will cool insiode the dog house,1
28110,10,"white :: White will keep the doghouse at a cooler temp erature than any of the other colors will, thus preventing the dog from o ver heating. This is proven by the fact that after ten minutes, a jar wit h a white lid had an increased temperature of 18(DEG)C, while jars with darker lids (ranging from light gray to black) had an increase in tempera ture of anywhere from 21(DEG)C to 29(DEG)C. The white lid kept the jar cooler, so it will keep the doghouse cooler as well. This is healthier fo r the dog.",2
28111,10,black ::  the color black would effect the air tempature of the dog house because in the scenario it says darker colors absorbe more energy.,1
28112,10,"black ::  If you painted the outside of a dog-house, th en the inside would be warmer. No matter what color you painted the insid e.",0
28113,10,"white :: white would be the best color to chose for th e doghouse, because white reflects off the sun. It doesnt absorb it like black, dark grey, or grey.",0
28114,10,"dark gray :: The best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because its close to median of the data. Also, the average temperature for dark gray is 48(DEG)C, this shows that the color can a bsorb and reflect light, so in cold days the doghouse will stay warm and on hot days the temperature inside the doghouse will be cooler.",1
28115,10,dark gray :: it will keep the temperature the same at all times,0
28116,10,"white ::  The white paint would help keep the dog house cooler when it is hot out. From the experiment, the white lid was the co olest out of all four lids.",2
28117,10,white ::  White will keep the doghouse cool becuase it reflects light instead of absorbing it,1
28118,10,white :: White will make the dog house cooler on the inside unlike black. White had a average of 42(DEG)c and black was 53(DEG) c.,2
28119,10,"light gray :: Light Gray was the color I would have chosen for the inside of the doghouse because, since black absorbs the most ener gy and the inside would have been hot. Dark Gray would have done the same thing as Black but just not as much energy would have been absorbed. Lig ht Gray would have been a perfect color, not only absorbing the perfect a mount of the light the inside would not have been as hot as the colors B lack and Dark Grey.",2
28120,10,"light gray ::  As shown in experiment that Brandi and Jerry conducted, we learned that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs. Knowing this, we wouldn't want the dog to get overheated, so we would panint the dog house the lightest color available. Which in this case, is white. Though, the dog, being a live creature shouldn't get too cold, therefore, light gray is the perfect compromise. Keeping the dog wa rm enough, but not too hot.",2
28121,10,"black :: This color black, could affect the doghouse b ecause the dog could get very hot in the Summer time. Also, the doghouse might get extremely hot from the sun and start to erode.",1
28122,10,dark gray :: i chose dark gray because it stayed the same heat every trial so it wouldnt be to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter,1
28123,10,"white :: Durring the experiment, Brandi and Jerry foun d out that white was the color that least affected the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it. If the white color was paint ed apon the top of the dog house, then the temperature wouldnt rise as mu ch as the black coored paint because, jerry and Brandi made there experim ent and got the results of white having the least affected air temperatur e when a lamp is directed at the jar. For example, on Trial 1, the white container had an air temperature of 42(DEG)C versis the air temperature in the black jar of 54(DEG)c.",2
28124,10,light gray ::  its cool but it gets some heat for the dog,1
28125,10,white :: Its Going To Be Cooler For The Dog In The Ins ide Than The Darker Colors Because they do absorb more energy and that wi ll make the doghouse very hot in the inside.,1
28126,10,light gray ::  light gray could affect the inside of the dog house cause the color is not to dark so that it wont be to hot and its n ot to light so it wont be to cold the temperature will be just fine.,1
28127,10,"white :: it will keep the doghouse cooler than any of the other colors becuase it stayed in a termperature of low 40(DEG)C. li ght gray was in high mid 40(DEG)C, dark gray in high 40(DEG)C, and blac k was in low 50(DEG)C proving that lighter colors keep the air temperatu re cooler",2
28128,10,"light gray :: I picked dark gray because in the experiment it resulted having darker colors absorbs some heat. So that means lighter colors help reflect. Light gray helps absorb heat in the winter just a l ittle, and in the some helps reflect a good amount.",2
28129,10,black ::  they should make the dog house black so that it will keep the dog warmer in the winter becuase more heat will be absorbed. The black lid was an average of 5(DEG) warmer then the second warmest color so the dog will stay nice and warm inside the dog house,2
28130,10,light gray :: The tempature of the dog house would be from 44(DEG)C to 46(DEG)C. The dog house will be at a neutral condition beca use it will not be too hot or too cold,1
28131,10,"light gray :: I choose dark gray because the light grey is perfect.say that its a could wet day.the dog is really could. the dog cou ld go into the dog house and stay warm with out being over welmed with he at from his body and fur. the color's averge tempurture was 48 degrees ce lceas.it keeps most of the temp in but leaving some out. also it gragulla y was getting warm at a slow pace.wich would help the dog alot when it ge ts to summer time so he dosnt get over heated,buy the suns heat",1
28132,10,dark gray :: Dark gray is better because it will get hotte r in the doghouse but not too hot.,1
28133,10,white :: the heat would be less atracted to white than the rest of the colours,1
28134,10,white :: it wont make it as hot it'll make it cooler,1
