25952,10,1,1,white :: this color will keep the dog house cooler ins ide because it doesn't heat up as fast. the average time for the glass to heat up was 42 degrees in 10 minutes.
25953,10,2,2,white :: I would use a light color like White in this case because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a black dog house the dog house is going to be hot.Like in the experiment they used they used a black lid because it would make the jar the hotest.
25954,10,0,1,"light gray ::  The darker of color the , the hoter it g ets"
25955,10,1,0,light gray :: i think it will affect it by the doghou se atrackting heat and if neede they could paint it another color when it gets colder of warmer
25956,10,1,1,black ::  the color would absorb more heat from the sun making it hotter in the doghouse
25957,10,1,1,"light gray :: i chose light gray because i was thinking of temperatures of the seasons. in summer the light gray will reflect some o f the heat while keeping it alittle warm inside, in winter the ligh t gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside ."
25958,10,2,2,white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to ho t because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the w hite lid had an averge of 42 degrees. There for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside.
25959,10,2,2,"black ::  The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside. The average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG), the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG). The average temp erature for the light gray was 45(DEG) and for the white it was 42(DEG) . There is a 11(DEG) difference between the black and white colored lid. So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside."
25960,10,0,0,white :: the color white will reflect the sunlight just like the white lid reflected the light from the lamp in the experiment.
25961,10,1,1,white ::  it would reflect a lot of the light and heat making it cooler inside the doghouse.
25963,10,1,0,black :: Well the darker the lid is the more tempayure goes into the jar. and the avarege of the black lid was 53(DEG)C.
25964,10,0,1,white :: they would want to choose white for the summer because it wont attract alot of heat. they would want to use black for the winter to attract more heat
25966,10,1,1,black :: it will keep the inside of the dog house warm er
25967,10,1,0,light gray :: Light Gray Is The Best Color To Use Because I tself Is That Dark Of A Color So The Dog Wont Burn Up(Darker Color=Increa se In Heat Tempeture)And Not That Light That The Dog Would Be Cold.
25968,10,2,2,"white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint becau se in the experiment, the jar with the white lid increased the least in t emperature. It increased 18(DEG)C while the black lid made the temperatu re increase 29(DEG)C. Therefore, the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesn't overheat."
25969,10,1,1,white :: The color white would affect the doghouse it so it may be cooler inside because of the lack in absorbing energy.
25972,10,1,1,light gray :: the doghouse should be light gray because it does not absorb to much heat or to little heat so the dog won't be to hot or to cold it will be just right
25973,10,2,2,white :: If they colored the doghouse white then it wi ll be cool inside and not so hot like it would be if it was black. Because when the jar lid was black the inside of the jar was 53(DEG)C an d when it was white the inside of the jar was 42(DEG)C
25974,10,1,1,dark gray :: The air inside will be hotter than it would b e with the light gray and white as the roof color so the dog can stay war m at night but it also be colder than if the black was the roof color so the dog won't get too hot during the day.
25976,10,2,2,black :: It will effect the dog house by it being more hot cause on the chart it showed black was the hottest
25977,10,2,2,"light gray :: The light gray color would reflect some of th e light energy, but also absorb a little so the doghouse would not get to o hot or cold. The white color had an average of 42(DEG)C after 10 minut es, which might be too cold. The dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, w hich might be too hot."
25978,10,0,0,black :: no color will affect the doghouse
25979,10,1,1,dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use because it would not be too hot inside. If you were to do black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat. In every trial for dark gray it created 48(DEG)C. This seems like a pretty good temperature for a dog house.
25981,10,0,0,black ::  I chose black because the sun wont reflect th e color black and it wont effect inside the dog house.
25982,10,1,1,white ::  It will make the dog house cooler
25984,10,1,1,white ::  It should be white. The white lid average was 42(DEG)C and it was the lowest average of temperature for the experimen t.
25985,10,1,1,white :: The white color reflected the most thermal en ergy and will keep the dog cool.
25986,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  It will make it warmer than a light grey or w hite doghouse, but cooler than a black doghouse. This is better because d ogs generally use a doghouse to hide from the rain in winter, and my colo r will keep it warmer. However, they are also used in summer, and as such should not be black, as that would make it unusable during summer."
25987,10,1,1,black :: The black doghouse would keep you warmer in t he winter but it would be really hot in the summer
25988,10,1,1,white :: the color will keep the dog house cool on the inside so on hot summer days the dogs can be nice and cool
25990,10,0,0,light gray ::  I chose light gray becasue it won't make the dog feel sad.
25991,10,2,2,"light gray ::  The light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm. On average, the light gray colored lid went from 24(DEG) C to 42(DEG) C (a difference of 21(DEG) C). Compared to the black color ed lid, which went from 24(DEG) C to 53(DEG) C (a difference of 29(DEG) C, which is too hot). Or the white colored lid which went from 24(DEG) C to 4 2(DEG) C (a difference of 18(DEG) C). Therefore, a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse."
25992,10,2,2,white :: white will keep the dog house nice and cool s ince according to there data the white lid kept the air in the jar cooles t.
25993,10,2,2,black :: the black one will have a good heat for the d og because in the trial the black lid was average was 53 (DEG)c .
25994,10,1,1,white :: the color of the dog house will affect the te mperature of the inside of the dog house. the color white will keep the t emerature lower than the other colors.
25995,10,2,2,light gray ::  I think white would be the best color for the doghouse becuase according to the experiment it was the coldest so in th e summer when it is hot outside the doghouse will not be to hot.
25996,10,1,1,"white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white because the color absorbs less heat, so it will keep it cool and no t too hot for the doggy."
25997,10,1,1,light gray :: It wont be to hot on sunny days and it wont be to cold on cloudy days.
25998,10,2,2,"white :: White would be the best color for the doghous e because it would keep the dog cooler. White would absorb less solar and thermal energy, therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse. In the experiment, the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42(DEG) C, while the black lid jar averaged 53(DEG) C. The light g ray lid produced and air temperature of 45(DEG) C and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48(DEG) C."
25999,10,2,2,"black :: Black will make the dog house warmer inside b ecause darker colors absorb more energy. And in ""Air Temperature"" the average temp. for black was 53(DEG), while the average for white was 42(DEG) . Every starting temperature started at 24(DEG), therfore, black would be the best color to choose for the dog house."
26000,10,2,2,"black ::  black will be the based color for the dog hou es because.In the chart ""lid color vs.Air temperture Inside Glass Ja r""black hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3.Dark gr ay,Light gyay,and White where in the low to high 40's.black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed."
26001,10,1,1,light gray :: The color light gray will affect the inside o f the dog house because it will get warm but not too hot because if you h ave a dog house that is way to hot the dog might die and since dog houses are always out in the sun the dog house will become extremely hot becaus e in the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly.
26002,10,2,2,white :: Using white paint would be a great paint colo r for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlig ht and so it would be cooler. If you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45(DEG)c so white would be a great doghouse color.
26003,10,1,1,white :: Because white does not asborb as much energy so it would be cooler in the dog house.
26004,10,2,2,"black :: If Brandi and Jerry use black, then the tempe rature will be warmer, because it has the highest average temperature at 53(DEG)C.If they use white, then it will bne colder, because the average when white was 42(DEG)C. Therefore the darker the doghouse the warmer i t will be because black was 11(DEG)C more than white."
26008,10,1,1,"black :: Because the doghouse will have a higher tempe rature because black absorbs more solar energy, which will transform into thermal energy"
26010,10,1,1,"dark gray :: I chose a darker color like dark gray, becasu e it will absorb more energy so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter. However, another reason I chose a dark gray instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot in the summer."
26011,10,0,0,white :: because the lighter the colors are the least heat energy is going to be absorbed.
26012,10,2,1,"light gray ::  This would affect the doghouse because some l ight would be attracted to the house but not too much. In their experimen t the light gray lids tempature was 45(DEG). This would be a good tempat ure for the dog house because in the summer the dog would have enough sha de so that it would not over heat, but in the winter it would be warm eno ugh so that the dog would not be cold."
26013,10,2,2,"white :: White would keep the dog house cooler. White does attract heat like the color black does. When started at 24(DEG)C, t he black lidded jar went up to an average of 53(DEG)C. And the white lid ded jar, which also started at 24(DEG)C, only went up to an average of 42(DEG)C."
26014,10,1,1,white ::  I would use white paint because it would keep the doghouse cooler. The doghouse will be cooler because the white paint will reflect the light and keep the doghouse cooler.
26015,10,0,0,white ::  it will afect the dog house by the temp in si de becaes the wight atracks less height
26018,10,1,1,light gray :: Light gray will be that color because you cou ld actually what color you are doing like when you paint that house and m aybe in the hot summer it wont be as hot if you paint the house bla ck.
26019,10,2,2,"white ::  according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature, the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb lig ht."
26021,10,2,2,"white :: It might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse. The data shows that the white lid has the lowest temperature, the refore making it the best color to build the doghouse with."
26022,10,1,1,white ::  the color white would keep the dog house nice and cool inside in a hot summer day.
26023,10,2,2,"white :: The white paint should keep the inside temper ature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day, than say black paint for examp le. When comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the whi te lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature. On average about 6.6(DEG) C cooler, compared with the averages for the other lids. So, therefore white pa int is the better choice, especially if you are looking to keep the insid e of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day."
26024,10,2,2,white :: In the expirement is stated that light er col ors are cooler than darker colors.White is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the dog house won't be to hot.
26025,10,2,2,light gray :: Light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much. Its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it wo uld keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool.
26026,10,2,2,white ::  if the dog house was white then when it is ho t the dog house would be cooler.in the experiment it showed that the aver age tempature for the air was 43 celcius and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 celcius.
26027,10,2,2,"white :: White will affect the dog house by making it cooler. In the trials, the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as."
26029,10,2,1,"black :: Black would be a good color for the doghouse because black absorbs more heat. Black absorbs more heat because it is made of no color so it does not reflect any color of light which means it absorbs all the light. In the experiment, the black held an average of 53(DEG) C after being under the lamp for ten minutes. The white lid had an average inside temperature of 42(DEG)C after beign under the lamp for ten minutes. This is a difference of 11(DEG)C and is because white is made up of all the colors so it reflects all colors of light whereas the black relfects no light."
26031,10,1,1,"white :: the color i chose, white, would affect the te mperature because white absorbs less light making the doghouse not as hig h in temperature."
26033,10,2,2,black ::  The black would be better to use for a paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer for the dog because in the experiment black made the jar the warmest.
26034,10,1,1,black :: If you use the black then the doghouse would stay warm when ever the sun is out beacause the sun would get more light because it is darker.
26035,10,1,1,"dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse dark gray because the temperature, according to their data, is 48(DEG)C and it's perfect temperature, not too cold nor hot, and it barely changes temperature."
26037,10,1,1,white :: Lighter color means cooler house.
26039,10,1,1,light gray :: This color would effect the doghouse because it would not be to hot or to cold.
26040,10,1,1,white :: The color black tends to make things hotter a nd so if u used a white lid it would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day. For the black lid in the experiment the tempature increased( t emp:54) and for the white it decresed(temp:42). This is because the energ y is sucked out from the dark colors. Also dogs have alot of fur so it wo uld be best to have a cooler house.
26041,10,2,2,white :: I would paint the dog house white. The highes t temperature was 53(DEG) for the black lid. Which would cause the dog t o overheat. While the lowest temperature was 42(DEG) for the white lid. Which would help the dog stay cool. So i would paint my dog house white b ecause it is 11(DEG) cooler than painting it black.
26042,10,1,1,white :: the white is better for the dog house because it wont get to hot inside and not to cold.the hotest it would get in the house is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
26044,10,0,0,white ::  I think white is the best coler out of all of the choses here because black is not esey to find in the dark but white is esey to find.
26045,10,0,0,black :: it might blow it up
26046,10,1,1,white :: this color is the best becouse it wont atract so much heat energy and it would be fresh for the dog
26047,10,0,0,white :: it will start like geeting old and it wont look like new anymore it will have like scratches and mud and some black things
26048,10,2,2,"white :: it would be much cooler inside the dog house because the color is light and reflects light better. as it said in the r esults, it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degree's Celcius"
26049,10,2,2,"light gray :: I chose light gray as a good color for the do ghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black. The color black which absorbs a lot of energy, results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as li ght gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures. Based on the experiment, the results show that that light g ray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45(DEG)C, 8(DEG)C less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures. Therefore, a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray."
26050,10,2,2,"black :: the darker the doghouse color, the greater th e increase in air temperature in the doghouse because the color absorbs m ore energy. In the experiment, the color black absorbed the most energy, causing the inside of the jar to be the warmest. The results for black we re 54 (DEG)C, 52 (DEG)C, 54 (DEG)C, and 53(DEG)C. While all the other colors that were lighter, absorbed less energy."
26051,10,2,2,"white ::  i honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors (dark gray, black,light gray) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors (white) the sun reflects off of it so w hite would be best because it would keep the dog when its in the dog house white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot day but thats my opinion and thats why i would pick white, what would u pick?"
26054,10,2,2,black :: The doghouse will be warmer. The doghouse wil l be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest .
26055,10,1,1,light gray :: They would want it between black and white so it will be warm and cool. The tests showed that Dark or Light gray is ab out 46.5(DEG)C so it will be good for the dog.
26056,10,1,1,dark gray :: i think dark gray because in the summer it wo nt get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to kee p the dog house fairly warm.
26058,10,2,2,"black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse, because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the dogh ouse warm. According to the results of Brandi and Jerry's experiment "" lid vs. air temperature"" the balck lid kept the inside of the jar warmer t han any of the other colored lids. So, therefore the black paint would ke ep the inside of the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors."
26059,10,0,0,dark gray :: because that would be the color to choose
26060,10,1,1,"white :: I chose white because white is a nice cool te mperture and dogs have fur so then they would be even a little bit hotter . The reason i know that white would be a pretty good temperture is becau se in the experement the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus, and so that is apretty good temperature for the dog house."
26061,10,1,1,dark gray :: it might get a little warm in the day time bu t it will keep the inside of the dog house warm in the night.
26062,10,2,2,white :: The color white would be a great color to use in a doghouse because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog soo when its hot then it wont be to hot in its house. I say this bec ause the average temp of the color white is 42(DEG)C while the other 3 c olors are above this average temp.
26063,10,0,0,"light gray :: This could color might affect the doghouse, b ecause the temperature in the doghouse could change depending on the temp erature outside the doghouse."
26065,10,1,1,"white :: If the doghouse was white then when it is hot outside the dog will be cold, and when it is cold outisde the dog has fu r to keep him warm."
26066,10,1,1,white ::  The doghouse will stay cool because white ref lects all the colors heat so the house will stay cool.
26069,10,1,1,black :: Black will affect the dog house by heating it up because black absorbes more energy.
26070,10,1,1,white :: White was written down as the coolest in the test and you would want the dog house to be cool when it is hot out.
26071,10,1,1,white :: The internal temperature of the doghouse will be cooler than a doghouse that is colored black. This is only the case i f the external temperatures are hot and the dog needs a cool place.
26072,10,2,2,"white ::  White is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for. After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day? I chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray, dark gray, or black lidded jars. With a starting temprature of 24(DEG)C for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42(DEG)C while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53(DEG) C was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11(DEG) C cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid. Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me."
26074,10,2,2,"black :: Having a black doghouse will keep the dog warm in the winter because the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment shows that darker colors obsorbe more heat than lighter colors."
26076,10,2,2,"light gray :: brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse L IGHT GREY because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so t hat is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and i ts not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45(DEG) and for black it was 53(DEG) a nd dark grey 48(DEG) and for white was 42(DEG) light grey is the averag e of them all, 53 ( black) - 48 (dark grey) = 5 53 (black) - 45 ( light grey) = 8 and 53 (black) -42 ( white) = 11 light grey (8) is i n the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should pain t the dog house."
26077,10,1,1,black ::  It will make the dog house warmer inside
26078,10,2,1,"light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for the do g house because it would absorb some heat, but would not absorb as much a sthe color black. If they chose black they dog house would absorb to much heat as shown in the experement that after just 10 minutes the temperatu re of the black lid jar rose 29(DEG)c but the light grey lid jar only ro se 21(DEG)c. Since black absorbs so much heat, it could cause the dog to be to hot, but light grey allows the dog to still have some heat just no t as much."
26079,10,1,1,light gray :: the color would keep the dog house cooler tha n the darkgrey and black color.also its warmer than the white colored hou se.
26080,10,1,1,black ::  The color black absorbs all the colors of lig ht so the inside of the doghouse would be hot becase the color is absorbi ng and trapping the heat from the light.
26081,10,2,2,light gray ::  dark colors makes things really hot for examp le the black reached up to 54* C white color makes things a little to cold for example it only reached up to 43* C the color gray would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but was to hot because for example the color gray reaced up to 46* C at most making it an equal balance between to hot and to cold.
26082,10,1,0,white ::  White will be better for the doghouse because it will be more heat efficiant and will let in less heat. if black was u sed it absorbs more heat then lighter colors would.
26083,10,0,0,"black :: cuhzz i t will effect it cuhz black is a rlly dark colerr,so yahh...."
26084,10,1,1,black :: The color will affect the doghouse by making the temperature rise high that it will be to hot for the he or she dog. Also on Trial 1 after 10 minutes it rised to 54(DEG)c which is to h igh the best color to paint a dog house would be white that was 42(DEG)c after 10 minutes.
26085,10,1,1,white :: it would make it nice and cool for the dog
26086,10,1,1,white ::  The temperature inside the dog house will be cooler than if they use a darker color such as black.
26087,10,2,2,"white :: brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray. painting the dog house light gray would be the b est paint to color the bog house because in the experiment they had foun d out that, painting the house black absorbs more heat energy, and pain ting it white will not absorb enoff energy, so in the middle will be the best for the dog. so not too much thermal energy, but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best."
26088,10,1,0,"white :: The best one would be white, because the whit e one absorbs less energy. The black one absorbs a lot of energy, the ave rage of the black one was 53(DEG)C. Average for the dark gray was 48(DEG)C. The average for the light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the white wa s 42(DEG)C. The darker the color the more energy it absorbs. The lighter the lesser it absorbs energy."
26089,10,2,2,"white :: the color white won't attract as much light a s the black so the dog won't have to suffer really hot weather on sunny d ays. the white compared to the black is a better choice because black col or attracts more light, for example it averaged a 53(DEG)C while the whi te averaged a 42(DEG)C. That is a ll(DEG)C difference."
26090,10,0,0,black ::  so the dog will stay warm at night.
26091,10,0,0,white :: because it could get dirty or somethen.
26093,10,1,1,"white :: Well the color ""white"" makes it so that inside of the doghouse would be more cooler because the sun reflects off white and it wont be as hot inside the doghouse."
26094,10,1,0,white ::  i chose white because the darker colors absorb more heat energy that the lighter colors
26095,10,2,2,"black :: I believe that the best color for the dog hou se would be black especially in the winter because it will keep the inside of the dog house warm because the darker the color of the object the greater increase in air temperature inside the object according to th e data table in ""Hot Lamp"" so the darker the color the warmer t he house or object."
26096,10,2,2,"white ::  According to the reults, the lighter the colo r, the colder the temperature is. Since white had less heat, they would w ant to paint the dog house white."
26097,10,2,1,black :: if the doghouse is black then it will be warm er. i know this because the jar with the black lid h ad an average temperature of 53(DEG)c
26098,10,2,2,"white :: The color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature . On average , the color black is 53(DEG)C , dark gre y is 48(DEG)C, light grey is 45(DEG)C, and white is 42(DEG)C ."
26099,10,1,1,black :: this color will keep the inside of the dog ho use warm during winter because dark color absorbs more heat energy.
26100,10,0,1,light gray :: Light gray might affect the the doghouse by k eeping the inside colder for the dog.
26102,10,1,1,light gray :: because light gray is in between hot and cold so the doghouse wont be to hot for him to stay in or too cold for the dog to stay in black being hottest and white being coolest
26104,10,0,0,"light gray :: Light gray would be a great color for a dogho use. Although it can still cause an affect. The light gray color can caus e the dog house to not have the right temperature in side. The results wo uld be that if the color was light gray is would be about a good temperat ure inside the dog house. Like in Trial 1 in the jar the temperature was 44, in Trial 2 the temp. was 45, Trial 3 it was 46 as the temperature. The average was 45, so with that said the light gray color is good enough because the average temp. is no t as bad and it wouldnt be so dark inside."
26106,10,2,1,black :: the darker the lid color the greater the incr ease in air temperature
26107,10,0,1,black ::  The wood will be hot
26109,10,1,1,"white :: The white paint would keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the sun, because it reflects the most energy, therefore having the lowest internal temperature."
26110,10,2,2,"white :: White would be the best paint color for the d oghouse. In the experiment, the temperature in the jar for the white lid averaged 42(DEG) C. The black lid jar averaged a temperature of about 53 (DEG) C. The dark gray lid jar averaged 48(DEG) C, and the light gray l id jar averaged 45(DEG) C. The white lid jar was the coolest out of the four."
26111,10,1,1,black :: It will be warmer inside of the dog house.
26112,10,2,2,"dark gray :: The best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray. In the experiment of the glass jar it had an average of 48(DEG) C and was the second highest temperature. The highest temperature was the black lid with 53(DEG)C. The difference of the highest temperature and second highest temperature was the 5(DEG)C. If using the dark gray paint color it would still absorb energy to keep the dogs warm, but yet be a bit coo l for them too."
26113,10,2,2,"white :: White, because it will keep the doghouse at a cool temperature (about 42 (DEG) C) in the summer when the dog is outside and needs a rest."
26114,10,1,1,black :: this color would affect the dog house because the black would absorb energy from the sun and make the inside of the do g house hotter then the rest of the colors
26115,10,1,1,"light gray ::  With a light gray dog house the temperature i nside the house would be cool in the summer, but warm enough for th e dog in the winter. with this balance in temperature you dont have to wo rry about the dog being uncomfortable during any season."
26116,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  It didnt get any hotter or cooler, therefore it is the best paint color for the dog house because the dog would not be too cold, nor too hot."
26117,10,1,1,light gray ::  light gray is more as cooler than black or dark gray in the summer but black and dark gray will be warmer in the winter light gray or white. Meaning light gray is in the middle.
26118,10,1,1,white :: In the hot summer months the dog house won't get too hot.
26119,10,1,1,black :: the darker the coler is the more hotter it is going to be in the inside and as in black what i picked it is going to w arm for the dog to sleep at night.
26120,10,0,0,light gray :: because it stays at a liveable temp. of 45 de grees.
26121,10,0,1,white :: If they paint the doghouse white then when th e dog goes inside it wont be so hot in there for him to sit in there.
26123,10,0,1,black :: The color may affect it by the temperature of the air may be cooler than the other colors
26124,10,1,1,"white :: the white color will attract less energy than the others, thus making the doghouse cooler"
26125,10,0,0,white ::  The color would affect the paint house becaus e. if it is a black colored house. it will be super dark. if it was a whi te color house it would be more lighter. during night time
26127,10,0,1,white :: the color on the outside will either heat up or cool down the doghouse and since white was still warm but not too hot so white is the best color for the doghouse.
26129,10,1,1,light gray :: I would choose light gray because then the dog won't be too hot or too cold.This is why I would choose light gray to paint the dog house.
26130,10,1,1,"white :: this color will surely make the doghouse much cooler. I am not sure whether the question is asking which one will keep the dogg cool or hot, so i am choosing white. This color will keep the d og cool when it is hot and sunny. However, this color will not keep the dog warm in the winte r, so i am not sure."
26133,10,2,2,"white :: White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat. The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat, so it will keep the doghouse cooler."
26134,10,2,2,white ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite. This is because white doesn't attract as much heat. I know this beca use in the previous experiment the average temperature for the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius. Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot.
26135,10,1,1,dark gray ::  Dark gray will make the dog house a bit warme r. The data states that it is 48(DEG) C always.
26136,10,1,1,"white :: White reflects more sun, keeping the dog cool er in the summer heat."
26137,10,1,1,"light gray :: Light gray won't absorb too much sun in which case heating the interior, and it will absorb enough heat on cold days t o warm inside."
26138,10,2,2,dark gray :: I choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the e ffect will be warm and cool at the same time. When you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an av erage of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too ho t and it will not get too cold.
26139,10,2,2,"white :: I think white would be the best color to pain t the dog house. I say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler. In the experiment, the white on average was 42(DEG) C, and that was the coolest temperature. The warmest temperature of the air in side the jar was the black with 53(DEG) C. For a dog inside a doghouse, i think it shouldn't be hot for the dog, that's why I chose the color tha t made the doghouse the coolest."
26140,10,1,1,black :: the black wood paint would effect the tempera ture more becaasue the darker a color the more energy in attracts. so the black one would be hotter than the white one.
26142,10,2,2,white :: the dog house will not be to hot. the tempera ture will rise but it will not rise alot it will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about the dog house getting to hot. white is the one that stayed the coolest and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature the whole time.
26143,10,2,2,"black ::  In my oppinion, Brandi and Jerry would want t o paint the doghouse dark gray because it had an average temperature of 48(DEG)C which is the second hottest temperature out of the four lid colors. I think dark gray would be the logical color to paint a dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the dog warm, but during the summer it won't be to uncomfortably hot like black may be."
26146,10,1,1,white :: The color would affect the doghouse because the lighter the color is the cooler the house would get. if the dog house was black then the doghouse would be too hot.
26147,10,1,1,"white :: The color will heat up the doghouse to about 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This is the best color to choose, because the bl ack heated up to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. Therefore, the temperature of t he white jar was 9(DEG)C lower than the black jar, making the white cool er."
26149,10,1,2,"white :: The color would affect the temperature inside the dog house. The black would make the temperature inside the greaterst then, the dark grey then, the light grey, then finally the white would h ave the lowest temperature just like the lid color. For the lid colors, b lack had an average of 53(DEG)C, the dark grey had an average of 48(DEG) C, the light grey would have an average of 45(DEG)C, aand the white had an ave rage of 42(DEG)C so the temperature for the dog house would be close or be to the same as the temperature of the jar."
26151,10,0,0,dark gray ::  keep it cooler
26152,10,2,2,"light gray :: A light gray color could give you less heat i n the summer but during the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth. Since in the experiment the black lid would get the most hea t you woulnt want a dog to get to hot, but also not to cold."
26153,10,0,0,black :: cAUSE HE MIGHT NOT WAMT TO SLEEP IN THE DOGHO USE CAUSE OF THE COLOR OF IT AND IT MIGHT ALSO MESS THE DOGS EYES UP TO T HAT COULD ALSO BE IT IN THIS EXPERIMENT
26154,10,1,1,"black :: It would make it really hot inside the doghou se because the color black attracks more heat, As aposed to colors that a re very bright like white or light gray or light green even."
26155,10,1,1,black ::  painting the doghouse black might affect it b y attracting all the heat to it and might cause the dog to have a heat st roke while is laying inside.
26156,10,0,0,black :: balck becuase balck goes with every thing
26157,10,2,2,white ::  this is the best paint color for the dog hous e because in the experament it proved that the white matiral absorbed the least amount of heat therefore making the temp. in the jar the lea st
26158,10,2,1,white :: i would choose white because it is one of the lightest colors. also in the experiment it was proven that white stayed the coldest after 10 minutes. therefore in the sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it.
26159,10,1,1,black :: the dog house should be painted black because black absorbes heat. learned thin when the data table showed that the av erage tempature for black was 53(DEG)C. When the dogs out at night you w ould most likely want it to stay warm.
26160,10,1,1,"white :: because in the summer, the dog house wount ge t over heated because the average for the white lid in the hot lamp exper iment was 42(DEG)C and the black was 53(DEG)C."
26161,10,2,2,"light gray ::  The color chosen will affect the inside of th e doghouse because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts. From the experiment, black attracted the most heat (or air temperature) with an average of 53(DEG)C, and dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, light gray had 45(DEG)C, and the color white with 42(DEG)C on average. Based on these results, i think light gray is the best paint color for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat, fewer than darker colors, but from the average air temperature in the glass jar from the experiment, the air inside the doghouse would be more withstandable than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat. Therefore, light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse."
26163,10,2,2,black :: i think they should use a black for the dogho use because since we live in a generaly cold area and the black paint wou ld help keep the dog warm at night with the average temp of the air when the area is black is 53(DEG)c
26164,10,1,1,light gray :: Light gray would keep the dog house a bit war mer without making it too hot like the black and dark gray would.
26165,10,1,1,dark gray :: Dark grey is best because in the winter the d oghouse will absorbe heat. Also in the summer the doghouse will not absor be too much heat. like if it was black.
26166,10,1,1,light gray :: It makes the doghouse a little cool but not t oo hot because on hot days it should be cool for the dog to go in there a nd rest. On colder days the dog should be able to go in there and still b e a little warm.
26169,10,1,1,light gray :: the house wouldnt get to hot for the dog and it wouldnt be too cold it would be in the middle
26171,10,2,2,"black ::  I think black would be the best color for the doghouse. It will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars, the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature. This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out. When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot, it can sleep outside."
26172,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  it had a steady temperature, and for outside, it wouldnt be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray."
26173,10,2,2,"white :: If the doghouse was white, the inside of that doghouse would keep the temperature inside cool because, like in the experiment, the color white only got an average of 42(DEG)C. Unlike the col or black, which got an average temperature of 53(DEG)C."
26174,10,0,1,white :: less heat will be attracted to it.
26175,10,0,0,dark gray ::
26176,10,1,1,light gray :: it will be warm for a dog that is meant to be outside and cool during summer
26177,10,2,2,white :: I have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature. In the data from the previous experiment th e white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG) making it the least ho ttest.
26178,10,2,2,white ::  White would make dog house cooler i know this because when the lid color was white the average was 42(DEG)C compared to the average for black wich the average is 53(DEG)C.
26179,10,2,2,"black :: Black would be the best color, because it wou ld keep the house warmer. In the experiment, black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar (53(DEG)C)"
26180,10,2,2,light gray ::  It would absorb a little amount of heat for t he summer time when it's hot. But because it's also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter. I know this because the black lid abso rbed the most heat and the white lid absorbed the least heat.
26182,10,2,2,black :: black would kepp the dog house the warmest be cause of the averages of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
26183,10,1,1,black ::  The dog house would be to hot since darker co lors absorb more energy.
26184,10,0,0,black :: that color would affect the doghouse because it would be too dark in the inside and dogs dont have eye color so it wo uld be hard for the dog to see. it also takes way longer to dry then the other colors the other colors dryed in the 40's but the black color dryed in the 50 i would not recomend them to color it black
26185,10,1,1,light gray :: In the summer it will not abosrb much heat ke eping the dog cool yet in the winter it will still contain a decent amoun t of heat keeping the dog at least fairly warm.
26186,10,1,1,black ::  The color would affect the dog house because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day. Also i t will affect it because the darker the color the greater the incre ase in air temperature in the doghouse.It will also affect it because the darker colors absorb more energy.
26187,10,2,2,"black :: Black is the best color for the doghouse in o rder to keep the dgohouse warm. brandi and Jerry's data showed that the d arker the lid (or in this case, doghouse) the darker the color, the more increase in air temperature. Which in the lid experiment, the data showed that black on average had the highest data of 53(DEG)C while others lik e dark gray and light gray had averages of 48(DEG) and 45(DEG) C."
26189,10,1,1,"light gray :: Light gray would keep the temperature in the summer down so the dog wont over heat. Black Dark gray would be to hot in the summer the dog would over heat, White would be to cold in the winter and summer the dog would freeze. That is why Light gray would be perfect for the dog house color."
26191,10,2,2,"light gray ::  Light gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it cooler than it would with black paint, but warmer than it would with white. In warmer tempatures, the paint will not asborb as much sunlight, so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot. The black paint had an average tempature of 53(DEG) C, while the light gray had an average tempature of 45(DEG)C. That is a difference of 8(DEG)C. The light gray will keep the doghouse cooler, but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint. The white paint had a n average tempature of 42(DEG)C. The light gray paint would keep t he doghouse 3(DEG)C warmer then the white paint, but 8(DEG)C cooler tha n the black paint."
26192,10,0,0,white :: white will bring more light in the dog house because it is a light color and it attracts light and it will bring more in
26194,10,1,1,light gray :: the doghouse would be cooler in the summer an d not as cold in the winter the light gray lid was cooler than the black lid which would make it better for useing in a hot environment. the most comfortable color varies with the kind of environment and i am assu ming this is a rather warm environment.
26195,10,2,2,"white ::  The best answer would be white because white is a light color that won't absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer. When Brandi and Jerry performed their experiment they found that when a jar had a black lid on it, the temperature inside the jar was an a verage of 53(DEG)C. Whereas, when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42(DEG) C. That is an 11(DEG) differance. There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white."
26196,10,2,1,white ::  how the white might affect the doghouse is be cause it will be alot cooler than the other dark colors because the avera ge temperature of the darker colors are more then whites
26197,10,1,1,"white :: It might not give it much light from the sun or any heat because darker colors attract more energy and light. Just lik e with the jars and the lamp. The jar with a black lid had the highest av erage, therefore proving that darker colors attract more energy."
26199,10,2,2,"black :: Well, darker colors absob more heat than ligh ter energy, so if you paint the doghouse black than the inside of the dog house will be warmer than the inside of a white painted doghouse. When Br andi and Jerry used a black lid (dark color) for the experiment the resul ts were in the low 50's range, 52-54 (DEG)C. but when they used the whit e lid (light color) the results were in the low 40's range, 41-43 (DEG)C ."

26202,10,1,1,dark gray ::  the dog house will be warm during winter so t hat the dog will warm and cofortable
26203,10,2,1,white ::  this color will help the dog house cool becau se it is the clor that remained the coolest during the experiment.
26204,10,1,0,"light gray :: I would go with light gray because in the exp eriment it was at a good temperature of 45(DEG)F, Black was to hot at a temperature of 53 (DEG)F, Dark gray was a little to warm at a temerature of 48(DEG)F, And white was a little to cold at a temerature of 42(DEG) F."
26206,10,0,0,"white :: Using the color white to paint the dog house would make the dog house be the lowest increase in air temperature then t he other colors. The dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial. The dog house would be about 42 degrees and I know that because the first trial was 42 degrees, the second trial was 43 degrees and the third trial was 41 degress. The average temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color to use."
26207,10,1,1,white :: it would make the doghouse cooler inside
26208,10,1,1,"white :: If you paint the doghouse white, it will be c ooler inside than if you painted it black. Since black absorbs more energ y it will get hotter faster than if it was painted white."
26209,10,2,2,"white :: They should use white because in the other ex priment white was the coolist, so if they use white it will not get to ho t in the dog house."
26210,10,2,2,"light gray :: The color of the dog house should be light gr ay because it doesn't absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53(DEG)c and 48(DEG)c in the experiment, so the dog won't feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around, they probably already are hot enough. Also if it does get cold, light gr ay will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase it's temp erature was 48(DEG)c which is only 2(DEG)c less than dark gray, so i th ink light gray will be the best color for the dog house."
26211,10,0,0,black :: Because the lighter one top put on the doghouse is the white not the black because it a difference of nine.
26214,10,1,1,dark gray :: dark grey would be good because it wont get t o hot or to cold for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 4 8(DEG)c

26221,10,1,1,"white :: White paint will make the doghouse less hot, because it attracts less energy from the sun."
26222,10,1,2,"white :: White would be the best color to paint a dog house, because the light color soaks in less light than darker colors. Br andi and Jerry's experiment found that a jar with a black lid was 53(DEG) C after ten minutes, but a jar with a white lid was only 42(DEG)C."
26223,10,0,0,white ::  the doghouse will be warm when the sun hits i t but it won't be so hot and it will be closer to room temperature for th e dog.
26227,10,2,2,white :: it wpuld make it less hot by having white bec ause white is a light color and does not coduct that much heat as have bi n shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest av erage at 42(DEG) c
26228,10,1,2,black :: I choose the color black because it keeps in more light and it has hotter temperature. All the others had lower temper atures and the black was the highest temperature.
26230,10,2,2,dark gray :: The best color for the doghouse is dark gray because it won't be so dark that it will overheat the inside of the dogho use and it will also retain it's temperature longer through out the night . The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48(DEG). That i s better than the 53(DEG) average for the black and the 45(DEG) a verage for light gray because it will not be way too warm but it will ret ain it's heat.
26231,10,1,1,"black :: The color black would effect the inside of th e doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat, keeping the dog warm. As in the experiment, while the black lid was over the thermometer and th e light was 5 centimeters away, the temperature on the thermometer increa sed by 29(DEG) C."

26238,10,2,2,white ::  the reason they should pick white is because it will cool down the tempature in the dog house the reason I know that i s in the data they did for the experiment it tells you that white is cool er than the rest of the colors
26239,10,1,2,"black :: if a dog house was painted black, then the do g house would stay warmer inside because the experiment shows that the ai r temprature in a glass jar with a black lid on it had the warmest air te mprature of 53, 54, and 52."
26240,10,2,2,"white :: This color will keep the dog house rather coo l that way the dog will not over heat itself. In the experiment, lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature."
26241,10,2,2,light gray :: The light gray color might affect the inside of the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to light the inside wont be to hot or to cold. This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy. The light gray was about in the middle with 45(DEG)c so i thought it was the best choice for the dog.
26242,10,2,2,"white :: White will be the best color for the doghouse because the white lid kept the jar coolest, meaning that white paint wil l keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy than any of t he other colors. the white lid kept the jar an average of three deg rees celcius cooler than any other color."
26243,10,1,1,white :: If Brandi and Jerry dont want the dog to get to hot then they would want to pick white because it does not increase th e air temperature as much as black
26244,10,2,2,"black :: I think black would beb best to use for the d oghouse because on winter nights when it gets cold out, the black color o f the doghouse will keep it warmer. Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors. Black was 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes, while white was 42(DEG)C that is a change of 11(DEG)C warmer then the other."

26249,10,0,0,"dark gray :: Dark gray would be best to build a doghouse b ecause it the temperture stays the same every single time, which means if its cold the temperture stays the same. If its hot, the temperture stays the same and doesnt get to hot."
26250,10,2,2,"white :: White would cause the inside of the doghouse to not be so hot on the inside so the dog can stay cooler because with th e white lid, the inside of the jar was the coldest out of all the other j ars."
26251,10,1,1,dark gray :: The tempeture inside the dog house will be wa rm.
26252,10,2,2,"white ::  They should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast. After 10 minutes, white's tempature was 42(DEG) while black's was 53(DEG). That is an 11(DEG) difference. So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white."
26253,10,2,2,white :: The color white is best for the doghouse beca use the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air t empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white h ad an average of 42(DEG)C which means that the increase of air was coole r . So the color white will affect the doghouse by the increase of air fl ow and be cooler then any other color.
26254,10,2,2,"white ::  The white dog house would not attract as much heat as the darker colors, so if they want to keep their dog at a cool t emperature, then they should go with the white color. The average tempera ture for the black colored jar is 53(DEG) C. The average temperature for the white colored jar is 42(DEG) C. The black lided jar is 11(DEG) C h igher than the white lided jar."
26257,10,0,0,light gray ::  the dog will might sleep on the doghouse.
26258,10,2,2,white :: The white attracted the least heat than any o f the other colors. The white Low data for white was 41(DEG) and the hig h data was 43(DEG).
26259,10,2,2,white :: the white would keep the dog house nice and c ool in the experiment white attracted the least heat. example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black.
26260,10,2,2,white ::  painting a dog house white will keep it coole r than other colors. in the experiment white had an average temp of 42(DEG) C while black had a 53(DEG)C average
26261,10,2,2,"white ::  White would be the best color to paint the do g house. In the experiment white didnt absorb that much heat, stayi ng at a temperature of around 42(DEG). This would mean that the dog hous e would stay a cool temperature for the dog."
26262,10,2,2,"white :: The white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse. In the data Brandi and Jerry collected, white had t he lowest temperature average of 42(DEG)C. The next coolest was light gr ey with an average of 45(DEG)C, dark grey with an average of 48(DEG)C a nd the hottest was black with an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore white pa int will make the doghouse the coolest."
26263,10,1,1,"black :: Since black absorbs more light than the dark gray, light gray, and white, it will make the doghouse warmer. This will help because in the winter when he needs the doghouse the most, it will k eep him warm when he is inside of it."
26264,10,2,2,white :: White would be the best paint color for the d og house because on a hot day the dog wont get as hot. This is because f rom the results it was that white paint got as high as 43 and black got a s hot as 54
26266,10,2,2,"white ::  It would keep the doghouse cooler, especiall y in summer months when there are high temperatures outside (ex: in the experiment the average temperature of white was 42(DEG), the coolest temperature of them all) . This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating."
26269,10,2,2,white :: White would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot. This is because in the experiment the black absor bed the heat so it would be hotter so making it white according to the da ta will make the doghouse cooler
26270,10,0,0,white :: White would make it more comfortable for the dog and it would be warmer than black because the black absorbs more ener gy than light colors.
26271,10,1,1,"white :: If the doghouse was painted white, then the a ir temperature inside wouldn't change very much. It would be cooler."
26272,10,2,2,"black :: The inside of the doghouse would most likely be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the sunlight, therefore it would become hot on the inside. Results from the experiment are that the black lid had a high of 54 degrees celcius and that is higher than the rest of the colors."
26273,10,1,1,dark gray :: According to the results that they got this c olor remained constant throught all 4 trials. This means that if they use this to color the doghouse the dog wont get to hot or too cold but it wi ll remain a average temperature of 48(DEG)
26274,10,0,0,white :: decrease the tepmpature
26275,10,2,2,"white ::  hite will keep the doghouse cooler inside bec uase white attracks less energy than black, dark grey, and light grey. th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42(DEG)C"
26276,10,1,2,white ::  If they paint it white then the doghouse wont absorb much heat.In the experiment the average temperature in a white li d jar was 42(DEG) C
26278,10,1,2,"light gray ::  If it was black and it was summer, the dog wo uld be hot. And if it was white and it was winter the dog would freeze. S o light gray would be the best color for the dog. If the tempature was 24 (DEG) outside and the dog was cold, he could go in his dog house and it would be around 45(DEG) degrees in his dog house. So he wont freeze as m uch as he would as if he was outside."
26279,10,2,2,white ::  The black paint made the air in the jar 53 degrees while the white paint was only 42 degrees. The white paint woud be best for the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse cooler if it was hot outside.
26280,10,1,1,"black :: This color might affect the doghouse, because when the sun shines the sun in black then the temperature will ri se from the dog house and making the doghouse hot."
26281,10,2,2,"white :: White will keep the doghouse the coolest beca use the other colors got tempatures of 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG)C, and 45(DEG) C, but the white jar got 42(DEG)C."
26282,10,2,1,white :: this would make the dog house cool in the summer because in the experiment the white lid jar had th coldest temperature of 41(DEG) C.
26283,10,2,2,"dark gray ::  The doghouse wouldn't be too cold or too hot, it would be right in the middle. Black, which is 53 C (average) would be a little too hot and white, which is 42C would be too cold, so the one i m the middle which is dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house."
26284,10,0,0,white ::  the white might let sunlight come in the dog house
26285,10,1,1,black :: Black will affect the dog house because when is sunny and bright the color will attract the heat and it will make it e ven hotter in the out side and the inside of the dog house
26286,10,1,1,white :: white is best for the dog house because if it was black the dog house would get hot
26288,10,2,2,"white ::  By choosing the color white, Brandi and Jerry 's doghouse would be colder than if they chose any of the other color opt ions. In the experiment, the average temperature for black lid was 53(DEG) c, for dark gray 48(DEG)c, for light gray 45(DEG)c, and finally for white 42(DEG) c. Which means that the white doghouse would be colder than any of the other color options."
26289,10,2,2,"light gray :: I chose the color light gray.Light gray would make the dog house around 45(DEG) C average on the inside. The results show that light gray was an average of 45(DEG) C and black was an averag e of 53(DEG)C. White was an average of 42(DEG) C. Light gray is 3 degre es warmer then white and 8 degrees cooler then black. Light gray is a col or in between the temperatures, leaving the dog house not to hot or not t o cold."
26291,10,2,2,black :: The other colors had between 40(DEG) and 50(DEG) but black is hotter then the other colors.
26292,10,0,0,light gray ::  Black could turn the inside of the dog house to hot for a dog to be in it so i choose light gray because the heat it a ttracts will make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45(DEG) compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53(DEG) w hich would clearly be to hot for a dog.
26294,10,1,1,"dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the darker the colo r, the more heat it attracts. For example, during the winter, the dog ins ide the doghouse might get cold, so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside. But sometimes the dog might not want so much heat, so i picked dark gray instead of black. Also, another example is in the summer time, if the dog doesnt want to go outside, and stays in the doghouse, he doesnt have to be so hot. But he can also go o utside if the doghouse is to warm."
26296,10,2,2,"white :: using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day. the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53(DEG)C, the white lid was 11(DEG)C cooler then the jar with the blac k lid"
26297,10,1,1,light gray ::  it will keep it warm for those cold night an d keep it cool for those hot summer days.
26298,10,2,2,"black :: Using a black paint color for the doghouse wi ll make the doghouse nice and warm for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is needed the most. Due to the data, a black lid color had an average of 53(DEG)C. That will affect the doghouse by making the doghou se much more warmer in temperature. A white lid only had an average of 42 (DEG)C, making it too cold for the dog. That's why a black doghouse is b est for a doghouse to keep the dog warm."
26299,10,2,2,"white ::  White would be the best paint color because it doesnt attract as much heat as black, light gray, or dark gray because its the lightest color. This is good because in the summer, if the dog house attracted a lot of heat, the dog could over heat and get sick. The black lid got the hottest air temperature, having an average of 53(DEG)C, dark gray was the second hottest, having an average air temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest air temperature, on average being 45(DEG)C, and white had the lowest air temperature with an average of 42(DEG)C. These results show that the white lid attracted the least amount of heat, and is therefore why I believe that a white dog house would be best."
26300,10,0,0,dark gray :: The Dog house will be warm but it will probab ly always stay around the same temperature because in the trial Dark Gray was always 48 degrees celcius
26301,10,1,1,"light gray :: Light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the house because when it's warm the dog would not be too hot a nd when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm. As you can see in the data collected if they choose black color to paint the doghous e &amp; it was hot the dog which could harm the dog, and if it they painted it white around winter the dog would be freezing, so I believe t hat light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of th e doghouse as much as the other colors."
26303,10,2,2,white :: If you paint it white the doghouse will be co oler in the hot summer sun. In the experiment the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG) but it was 53(DEG) for the black lid. You pr obably don't want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white.
26305,10,2,2,"white :: White would affect the inside of the doghouse becuase it is a light color so it will absorb less enrgy becuase the dar ker the color the more enrgy it will absorb. In teh data table from their experiment, black absorbed the most energy and white absorbed the least energy so that is why they should choose white for the doghouse"
26306,10,0,0,black :: the best paint color for the dog house would be black because the darker the doghouse the grater chance it will have o ut in the sun
26308,10,0,0,black :: Black Will Efect The Dog House Alot In The Su mmer Because Balck Is An Energy Color.
26309,10,1,1,white ::  This color will affect the doghouse by making it colder. If they live in a hot place this would be the best color to c hoose from.
26310,10,2,2,white :: i think that brandi and jerry should paint th e doghouse white. i believe that white would be the best color because in the results it shows that white collects less heat and energy. that wpul d be good because if it was sunny and the dog wanted to go somewhere cool he would have his white dog house that doesnt suck in all of the heat.
26311,10,2,1,dark gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog. I know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees C after 10 minutes of being under the lamp.
26313,10,0,0,light gray :: it will heat the doghouse up just enough to b e the perfect temperature.
26314,10,1,1,"light gray ::  On hot sunny days the color of the house wouldn't absorb so much heat, So the house woldnt get so hot, But if it was a cold day the colors of the house could reflect the cold air, Becuas e, Lighter colors reflect heat, &amp; darker colors absorb heat."
26315,10,0,0,light gray :: because the dog might be jumpy and get mud paw prints on the house
26316,10,2,2,black :: The paint color will help to keep the dog war m becuse in the results of the experiment the black lid heated up faster.
26317,10,1,1,white ::  The Best color would be white because as show n in the table white absorbs less heat energy and therefore stays cooler so that means the dog would stay cooler.
26318,10,2,2,white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler. I know this because the temperature for the air in the glass jar with the black lid was warmer then the white lid.
26319,10,2,2,"black :: In the experiment the black lid on the jar he ld the most heat so if you colored the doghouse black the temperature ins ide the doghouse would stay at a higher constant temperature. The black l id had the highest average temperature of 53(DEG)C, dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had an average of 45(DEG)C and white had the lowest temperature with 42(DEG)C"
26321,10,2,2,"dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse dark gray, I think it would be just warm enough in the winter and just cool e nough in the summer, because dark gray has the medium-warm temperature on the chart about the colored lids."
26322,10,1,1,"dark gray :: I chose dark gray cause it will be warm for the dogs in the winter, and cool in the summer."
26323,10,2,2,white ::  in the experament the color white absorbed less heat. so if you want your dog to stay cool you should pick white that way he or she isnt as hot.
26324,10,0,0,dark gray :: easy to light make stay drak
26325,10,2,2,white :: The purpose of a dog house is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain. White is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar. The tempature of the w hite jar was an average of 11(DEG) C less than the tempature of bla ck jar.
26326,10,1,1,white ::  it will be cooler inside
26327,10,2,2,white ::  This color will cool down the dog house. The results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than al l other colors in the expirement.
26329,10,2,2,"white ::  Painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house. The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar. The darker the color of the lid got, the warmer the inside of the jar was."
26330,10,0,0,white ::  i think white because had the less average in side the glass. the reason i didnt pick the other colors is because it is gonna be to dark so therfore you couldnt see anything t night so t heir i would pick white because u can see them better
26332,10,2,2,white :: I chose white because the white paint color d oesn't abosorb that much energy than the other colors and also the air te mperature inside wouldn't be as high as the other colors. So if the white doghouse was placed under the sun and the starting temperature would be 24(DEG)C the average temperature would only rise up to 42(DEG)C. But if the color of the doghouse was black or gray than the temperature would b e in the 45(DEG)C - 53(DEG)C. So white doghouse would be a great pick f or the color of the doghouse.
26333,10,1,1,"light gray :: I picked Light gray because in the winter he can be warm and in the summer cool. This, color means that we wouldnt be hot on the summer and cold in the winter."
26335,10,0,0,white :: white doesnt take in colors from the rainbow like black and other colors
26336,10,2,2,black :: Black absorbs heat therefore it would make th e dog house warmer than all of the other colors. This can be supported be cause in the expirement black got up to 53(DEG)C and the white only got up to 42(DEG)C. Black was the warmest
26337,10,1,1,light gray ::  light gray would be best because it wouldnt b e not to hot and not to cold.
26338,10,1,1,dark gray :: Dark gray because it wouldn't be to hot and it wouldn't be to cold.
26342,10,2,2,white ::  the color white would be good for the doghous e becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse wont be hot. in the experiment the color white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors so it would be the best color for the dog house.
26345,10,0,0,light gray :: If you paint the inside of the doghouse light gray it would affect the temp. of the inside of the doghouse.It would ke ep it warm inside if it was cold outside.
26346,10,1,1,black ::  It might affect the doghouse because it obesv ers heat energy with a darker color.
26347,10,1,1,white ::  White paint would make the dog house cooler b ecause white paint reflects light.
26348,10,2,2,"light gray :: I chose light gray because that way the dogho use could stay cool and the dog wouldn't be too hot. Black was an average of 53, and Light gray was 45. So its a just right roof."
26349,10,1,1,black :: black absorbs more heat from the sun this is good beacuse in the winter the dog will be very warm insidebut durning th e hot summer ddays the dog probly wont use it so black would be the best option
26350,10,1,0,white :: white can reflect more heat then black becaus e black absorbs more heat
26352,10,0,0,white ::  the color white would be a good color for a d og house because from the data it says that the average temperature was 4 2(DEG) in side the jar thats only went up 18(DEG)
26353,10,1,1,light gray :: the color light gray will heat the dog house but it wont over heat it and it will not under heat it either.
26354,10,1,1,black :: Blacvk will affect the doghouse becuase It wi ll make it warmer for the dog to like in.
26355,10,1,1,"light gray :: I would chose light gray because on a cold da y, any heat you be absorbed into the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be that cold but on a hotter day, the gray wouldnt let in so much heat the the dog would be to hot."
26358,10,2,2,"dark gray ::  -they should use the dark gray beause they want the dog house warm for the winter and the nights but not to warm because of summer, if they use the dark gray then the dog house stays warm for the winter and not too hot for the summer. - this color will affect the inside because it is a darker color but it is not too dark the dark gray willkeep the dog house warm and cozy for the dog but not to warm for the summer. -the dark gray kept the jar at a tempature of 48(DEG), the black kept it at 53(DEG), the light gray kept it at 45(DEG), and the white kept it at 42(DEG). thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot. if they used the white the dog house would be too cold. the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog."
26360,10,2,2,light gray ::  That color would effect the dog house because when the sun was up it would maintain 44(DEG)-46(DEG)c. That would keep the dog comfortable while the sun was out.
26361,10,2,2,white :: The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause since white is a very light color it does not absorb light as well a dark color would.The dark color would not only absorb the light but woul d also create heat energy.From the results in the experiment white was th e color that I had chhosen because the air in the glass jar did not get n ear as hot as all the others.Also picking the color that didnt create as much heat as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog st ays cool.
26362,10,1,1,white ::  It would not affect the doghouse to much beca use it absorbs less heat then the other colors and that allows the doghou se to not get to hot.
26363,10,1,1,dark gray :: Dark gray will make the dog house absorb alot of energy but not as much as black because in the experiment it averaged at 48(DEG)c and black averaged at 53(DEG)c.
26365,10,1,2,white :: they should paint the dog house white because its is a light color and attracts less heat the black lid got the highest tempature showing they should not use black pain because it attra cts heat
26366,10,2,2,"white :: this color will affect the doghouse by making it cooler on the inside because in the air temperature data, Brandi and Jerry figured out that white colors didnt attract much heat because compa red to the black to white lid, the black lid was 11(DEG)C more hot than the white lid."
26367,10,2,2,"white ::  White would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors. This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot. In the scenario, the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the temperatures of the Black,Dark gray and Light gray lids were 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG) C and 45(DEG)C. This information shows that the white lid had a lower temperat ure than the other three lids."
26368,10,2,2,white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler then the rest of the colors. In the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black.
26369,10,1,1,"white :: i would paint it white, that way, showing fro m the table, the tempurature wouldnt get so hot."
26373,10,1,0,"dark gray :: This color would keep the doghouse warmer dur ing the winter and hotter during the summer. Therefore, this would be a g ood paint color for the doghouse. I know this because in the experiment t hey did, the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar wa s around 45(DEG), while the darkest colored lid was hotter, and the ligh test was cooler."
26374,10,1,1,white :: Because the lighter the doghouse is the coole r it is in the sun.
26376,10,1,1,white ::  White will attract a less amount of heat to t he doghouse. It is the best paint color because it will provide shelter f or the dog from the sun and provide a cooler environment.
26377,10,1,1,white ::  if they used white for the color of the dog hous it would keep the inside of it cool because white reflects ligh t.
26378,10,1,2,dark gray ::  I choose dark gray because the color will not make the doghouse too cold and not too hot. The results showed that the highest temputure was 48(DEG)C and the lowerest was 48(DEG)C.
26379,10,1,1,"light gray ::  I would chose light gray because from all the colors it isn't the least amount of air temperature and it isn't the gre atest. So, I believe that its just right for the dog because it won't suf ficate or it wont have to much. The first trial for the light greyt was 4 4(DEG)C and the temperature just went up by one which makes it 45(DEG)C and the third trial it also went up by one 46(DEG)C. This makes the hou se very predictable about what the temperature is going to be."
26382,10,2,2,black :: Black will make the doghouse warmer than the other colors because it got an average of 53 while the other colors got i n the 40's.
26383,10,2,2,"black :: Black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most. Black, based on the experim ent, was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids . For example, in trial 1, black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius. Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius. Evident ly, black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors."
26384,10,1,1,white :: White becase the doghouse wont get to hot for the dog and the temurature will be at a low risk for the dog to get heat stroke.
26385,10,1,1,light gray ::  Light gray is a good choice because it keeps the doghouse cool on a hot day but it will keep some heat on cooler days.
26387,10,2,2,white ::  If they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar w as 42(DEG)C for a white lid and 53(DEG)C for a black lid.
26389,10,1,1,"white :: The white dog house can help the dog cool off and it keeps it cooller in the Dog house unlike Black and the darker colors that abosorb, The heat and then so warm the dogHouse and There by inc reasing the Tem(DEG)"
26390,10,1,1,white ::  white because that color doesnt absorbs enery and the doghouse be cooler
26391,10,1,1,"white ::  it will make it cooler in there, so its not b urning hot in the summer"
26392,10,1,1,black :: if its black the doghouse might cunduct more heat but if you choose a lighter color it will not atract as much heat as the dark color.
26393,10,2,2,"white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun. White would be best because it will absorb the least energy, keeping the temp down, in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53, while the white color was 42, and 11(DEG) difference."
26395,10,1,1,"white :: Brandi and Jerry should use the color white f or the dog house because brighter colors reflect light to keep the dor co ol. Unless, it is the winter time and you want to keep the dog warm a dar ker color would be better."
26396,10,2,2,white :: I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house. White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day. When the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53(DEG)C. When the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42(DEG)C. This is a difference o f 11(DEG)C. White is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse bec ause it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day.
26397,10,1,0,"white :: The experiment shows that if the color is whi te, the less hot the object gets. So if Brandi and Jerry paint it white t he dog would not be as hot if it was black."
26398,10,0,0,light gray :: This color should make the doghouse a nice co ol temperature cosistantly. I say this because in the data table light gr ay's average temp. was 45(DEG).
26399,10,2,2,"black :: I think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it, bec ause black got the highest average of 53 C(DEG)"
26400,10,0,0,white ::  its not to dark
26402,10,2,2,dark gray ::  I chose the color Dark Gray Because when it i s cold outside the house will absorb heat and warm up the doghouse so it wont be cold. But when it is really hot outside it wont absorb as much energy as the black paint so it will be a little cool.
26404,10,2,2,white :: If your design for your doghouse was to keep the dog out of the heat then you should choose the white because after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color kept the temperature down to 42 (DEG)C while the black lid kept the temperature to 53(DEG)C
26405,10,1,1,"white :: If the color of the doghouse was white then i think the dog that lives there will want to go in the doghouse more ofte n because its not going to be really hot, its going to be cool."
26406,10,2,2,"light gray :: Light Gray. Because the color is not that dar k, but not that light ether. For the summer it wont be that hot, and in t he winter it wont be that cold ether. Also the tempetures of the data cam e out that the gray color is right in the middle(average) of the experime nt."
26408,10,0,0,"dark gray :: The greater the increase in the air temperatu re in the glass jar , because darker colors absorb more energy."
26409,10,2,2,"black ::  It would make it warmer for the dog so it wou ld be warmer inside the doghouse so the dog would not be too cold. In the experiment the results show that the darker the color, the warmer it is inside."
26410,10,2,1,"light gray :: Light gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse. One reason I chose this is because when the sun is beating down on the doghouse, the dog could overheat. Also, the opposite is true as well. If you had a white doghouse, it may make the dog very cold. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C, and the white lid had an average of 42(DEG)C. This makes a grey-painted doghouse the best choice."
26411,10,1,1,black :: i think that black she psint the doghouse bec ause it dark and it could absorb more energy and increase in air tempertu re.
26412,10,1,1,white ::  the test proves white dosent get as hot as ot her colors
26413,10,2,2,"white ::  the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as d oes darker colors, for example, in the air temprature expeirament. they p ut a dark colord lid over a jar, with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius. after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c. but when they p ut the lighter coverd lid over the jar (at a starting point of 24c) after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c. so the be st choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog."
26414,10,2,2,"dark gray :: The dark gray color for a doghouse might be b est to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives, b ut not overly heated in the summer. In the experiment, the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48(DEG). A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog. In the investi gation, the air temperature of black was at 53(DEG). The light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog. The air temperatures of the light g ray was 45(DEG) and of the white was 42(DEG). This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse."
26416,10,2,2,"white :: In the testing of which color made the air in side of the jar hottest, the black was the hottest, then came the dark gr ay, than light grey, then the white was the coolest so the air inside of the doghouse would be cooler if it was white which would be best for the dog."
26417,10,1,1,white :: it will make it cooler inside because the whi te coloer will deflect light from the house
26419,10,0,0,black :: be geos once you go black u never go back
26420,10,1,1,white :: they should choose white because they dont wa nt their dog to get really hot and white wont absorb that much heat so it will stay cool on the inside.
26422,10,2,2,"white :: White is the best color to use for the doghou se. This is becasue the color white reflects the most sunlight and theref ore it wont be as hot insdie the house. With the white colored jar lid, t he average tempurature is 42 (DEG) C. The averages for the Light Gray, D ark Gray and black lids were 45 (DEG) C, 48(DEG) C and 53(DEG) C. This shows that having the doghouse be white would keep the air cooler and mo re comfortable for the dog."
26423,10,2,1,"white :: It is the brightest color in this selection a nd the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb. The doghouse wil l usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the Sun' s solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average colum n of the data table. By doing so, you can see that White had the lowest a verage temperature at 42(DEG)C, while the Black had an average temperatu re of 53(DEG)C. Dark and light gray were also above white's average, mak ing white the best suited color for the doghouse."
26424,10,1,1,light gray ::  it will make it cool on warm and sunny days b ut on winter days it wont be too cold and it will act as both warm and co ld depending on the day
26425,10,0,0,white :: In the summer the doghouse would not be to wa rm and not as hot as warm as a doghouse that is black.
26426,10,2,1,black :: using the results from the experiment the bes t color for the doghouse if you were looking for the doghouse to be warm would be black because in the experiment it shows that black heats up the most in the same amunt of time.
26428,10,1,1,"dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse da rk gray, because then inside of the dog house it would not be too hot or too cold for their dog. If they painted the house black, it would be too hot. The average temperature was 53(DEG)c and the dark gray average temp erature was 48(DEG)c. Light gray and white would make the inside of the doghouse too cold, because those temperatures averaged at 45(DEG)c and 4 2(DEG)c. Therefore, dark grey is just right."
26430,10,2,2,"white ::  In the experiment they said darker colors aso rb more heat, and you do not want more heat in you're dogs house. And you dont want you're dog to overheat so I picked white so it stays cool duri ng the summer."
26431,10,1,1,"white :: I say that they should use white because from the data they had from the experiment,it shows that darker colors absorb s more energy then any other colors. White would not take as much absrob energy as shown in the data table given because it's a light color and it would be better for the dog not to have as much absorb energy in it's ho use."
26432,10,1,1,light gray :: If you were to paint the dog house light gray the tempature inside the dog house would not be as hot in summer time or not as cold in the winter time as if you were to pick white it would be colder and black it would be hotter and dark gray would be hotter just n ot as much. light gray would be just in the middle of all of them.
26434,10,1,1,white :: is because on a hot day it wont be as hot in the doghouse if you use white if you use b-lack the dog would be to hot.
26435,10,1,1,black :: It will be the hottest because darker colors absorb more energy.
26436,10,1,1,dark gray :: This color would make the doghouse warm but n ot too warm and it wont be cold inside either.
26437,10,2,1,light gray ::  I chose the light gray paint because in the summer time the dog house won't be too hot or too cold. The light gray rose 21(DEG)C in ten minutes where as the black rose 29(DEG)C and th at means that when it's hot outside the tempature in the dog house will b e hot and uncomfortable.
26438,10,1,1,white :: the inside of the doghouse would be cooler wi th the color white and with black it would be hotter
26440,10,1,1,"white ::  Having a white color for the dog house will effectively keep the dog at a temperature where the sun wouldn't gradually increase the temperature too hot for the dog to live inside dog house. According to a experiment on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar, a white lid did not help increase the temperature inside the jar. While a grey and black lids effectively increased the temperture over 6 degrees."
26441,10,0,0,"dark gray :: I choose dark gray as the color for the dogho use because the white color would be good for summer, but then during the winter the dog would get too cold. The black color would be good for win ter, but then during summer the dog would get too hot. The light gray col or would be good for summer, spring and winter, but not for fall. The dar k gray would be good for summer, fall and winter, and the dog would proba bly spend most of his/her time outside during spring. I would paint the d oghouse dark gray."
26442,10,2,2,"light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for a dog houise beacuse if the dog is outside and its cold outside, the light gray still atractas some warmth to it but not too much for when its hot outsi de. In the experiment light gray had the averge of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and the black had an avergae of 53(DEG)C. This shows that white would be too cold becuase it would not attract alot of sunlight. T he black is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool and warm."
26444,10,0,0,"black :: Trial 1: (54), Trial 2: (52), Trial 3: (54), Trial 4: (53). This color would keep keep it warm when It needs to be war m, and keep it cool when it needs to be cool."
26445,10,0,0,"white ::  That color might affect the doghouse, because the tempurtue will be good for the doghouse."
26447,10,1,1,"black ::  The color black absorbs more light, so the do ghouse will be warmer."
26448,10,1,1,dark gray :: the darker the color is the hotter the inside of the house will get so i picked dark grey because black might make it too hot when the sun is on it and white would be too cold.
26449,10,1,1,"black :: Black would affect the air temperature in the dog house. In the experiment the black lid color had on average of 53(DEG) C. This color would greatly effect the dog house in the summer. On hot days, the black color would attract heat, which would be a health issue for the dog."
26450,10,0,0,light gray :: Light gray would be a good color because if y ou used black then that would attract energy from the sun causing the sun to hitthe dog house and the dog will get to hot. So if we use light it w ill slightly attract some energy from the sun because the color is a mixt ure between black and white making the dog the right temerature.
26454,10,0,0,white :: It might affect it by the (DEG)c level in th e dog house and it will make it not as cold as the other colors so it a h otter tempature.
26455,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  the dark gray could help the dog stay cool in the summer but also stay warm in the winter. in the results of the lab, the dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment. The dark gray color would be the best color for the dog house."
26456,10,1,2,"black ::  How the color might affect the doghouse is by the temperature of the inside of the doghouse. With the proven fact by the experim ent that darker colors absorb more heat, painting the doghouse the color black will increase the temperature of inside the doghouse. In the experi ment, Brandi and Jerry got the results that the color black (out of all the colors) had the hottest temperature of the inside of the glass jar."
26458,10,0,0,"light gray :: Becasue it isn't too dark and it isn't too light , it's just right for the dogs eyesight ."
26459,10,1,0,dark gray :: That effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold.
26460,10,2,2,black :: if they use the color black the inside air te mpature would be the warmest according to there data.
26461,10,1,1,dark gray :: I think that a dark gray would be the best co lor to paint the dog house. Sense dark colors attract solar heat...but it all depends on where the dog house will be located...for example...if yo ur somewhere where its normally hot outside...you should paint the house white or light gray. But if this dog house is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside...paint it dark gray or black.
26462,10,0,0,black :: its my favorite color
26464,10,2,2,"white :: If you paint the dog house white, it will sta y nice and cool and won't get too hot because the data showed that when t he lid was white, the average temperature, 42(DEG)C, was colder than the others. When the lid was black the average temperature was highest, 53(DEG) C, which is 11(DEG) more than the white lid's average."
26465,10,0,0,white :: ti make ti litere
26466,10,1,1,white :: i think they should paint the dog house white because in the summer it will keep the doghouse cooler insi de and keep the dog from getting to hot.
26467,10,1,1,light gray :: Light gray might not affect the dog house bec ause in the summer when its really hot it went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark. The dog house might just be the right temperture not to hot and not to cold just right.
26469,10,1,1,white :: White would affect the doghouse by making it cooler than any other color shown.
26470,10,1,1,white :: white will make the dog house as cool as poss ible
26471,10,2,2,white :: Having a white colored dog house is the best option because its the one that got the lowest temperature in the experim ent which was 42(DEG)C average. And since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best. The other colors averages were black= 53(DEG)C dark gray=48(DEG)C and Light gray= 45(DEG)C which are to hot for a dog to be living in.
26473,10,2,2,"white :: whtie is the best color to paint the dog hous e because, in Brandi and Jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature. black had a ending tempature average of 53(DEG) C and the wh ite lid had a ending tempature average of 42(DEG) C. therefor, white wou ld be the better paint color to keep the dog house cooler for the dog."
26475,10,0,1,white ::  less solor energy less hot the dogs house wil l be
26476,10,0,0,black :: Because it's average is very high. And it cou ld do something to it.
26478,10,1,1,light gray :: it will heat the dog house so it is warm and not to hot or too cold because in the data the light gray color was just about the middle.
26479,10,2,2,white :: the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compare d to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
26481,10,2,2,black ::  if they used black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep all the heat in there for keeping the dog warm because the black will be traping in the heat that is why people don't wear black on a hot day. I can say this because in the data table for black the average temperature was 53(DEG) and that was the highest temperature there was this is why I think Brandi and Jerry should use black for there dog house.
26482,10,2,2,white :: It would make it cooler than the other colors . White ended up about 42(DEG)C while black was about 53(DEG)C.
26484,10,0,0,black :: Because dogs are colored blind and if the dog house is painted black then the dog wouldnt be able to see it.
26485,10,2,2,white :: White will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse. In the experiment white had an average of 42(DEG)C while the other colors had higher temperature averages.
26486,10,2,2,black :: The black paint would absorb heat. That would keep the doghouse warm. The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues.
26487,10,1,0,dark gray :: i how not mack the dog house black it will be to hot
26488,10,2,1,white :: It will make the air cooler becuase it's aver age was 42. It started at 24 so it only went up by 18 and black went up b y 29 because black ended at 53.
26489,10,1,1,dark gray :: dark gray would be better because you dont wa nt the dog to be cold if it were to live in the dog house but you dont wa nt it to be to warm for the dog.
26490,10,2,2,"white :: White is a very light color. But with black i t attracts the sun. so inside this doghouse when black, it can get hot. b ut with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53(DEG)c as the black had. the white had a average of 42(DEG)c which is not hot comp ared to 53(DEG)c."
26491,10,1,1,black :: the color affects the dog house by the tempat ure inside the doghouse if the color is darker it will be hoter if the co lor is lighter it will he colder and so on. and because the doghouse will probaly be outside i chose black so that it is warmer
26492,10,1,1,"light gray :: it won't be as hot inside of the doghouse, ma king it more comfortable for the dog in the hotter months, but it will st ill be warm enough that the dog will be comfortable in the colder months."
26493,10,1,1,"light gray ::  The color might affect the doghouse because l ight gray will not make it too hot or too cold, the temperature will be in the middle."
26495,10,2,2,"light gray ::  After being exposed to heat, white was the coolest with 42(DEG)C, followed by light gray with 45(DEG)C, dark gray, and then black. By using light grey, the doghouse would stay fairly cool in the summer, unlike black, and absorb a fair abount of heat in the cold winter, unlike white."
26496,10,2,2,"black ::  Well the darker the color is the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the dog is outsid e, so the dog will stay warm at a good temperature. on the table of the expirement it shows that having a black lid on trial one gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one it was only about 42 degrees. 12 degree difference!"
26497,10,1,1,white ::  it will not make it hot during the summer so the dog can cool him self
26498,10,2,2,"white :: i would choose white because it will keep the dog cool in the summer time because the white lid had an average tempera ture of 42(DEG)C whereas the light grey had an average of 45(DEG) C, the dark grey had an average of 48(DEG)C and the black had an average of 53(DEG)C."
26499,10,2,1,black :: If they use black paint on the doghouse then the doghouse will be hotter than with any other color. In the experiment the black lid's average temperature was 53 degrees and all the other colo rs were more cold.
26500,10,2,2,white ::  The color white would affect the doghouse by cooling it off because in the experiment the air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in comparison to the air temperature in the jar with the blakc lid which was 53 degrees. That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white.
26501,10,0,0,white ::  Whit wouldnt arelly affect it cause in the wi nter there is not much sun so the color would make no difference but in t he summer it would be the same because sun does not affect the color whit e especailly in the heat.
26502,10,1,1,black ::  becuase when it gets hot outside the sun atracts black and then it will heat up the doghouse and the dog house would get to hot and then the dog would really hot.
26503,10,0,1,white ::  White would probably be the best choice to paint the dog house. It would stay at a temperature of about 42(DEG)C. This color doesn't attract heat like black or dark colors do. So I think this would be the best choice.
26504,10,0,0,light gray ::  i have know idea
26505,10,2,2,"white ::  White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors. This is because, the average air temperature of the jar w ith the white lid was 42(DEG)C, the light grey lid was 45(DEG)C, the da rk grey lid was 48(DEG)C, and the balck lid was 53(DEG)C. The differenc e between the darkest (black) lid and the white lid was 11(DEG)C."
26506,10,2,2,white :: white so the doghouse stays cooler because ac ording to the table white makes the temp inside the jar the coolest
26508,10,1,1,white :: it will make it cooler for the dog and the do g wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
26509,10,1,1,white ::  The white paint color would keep the inside of the doghouse more cooler than the other colors because lighter colors absorb less heat.
26510,10,1,1,"black :: They should do the dog house black because th e aveerage in the expierament was 53(DEG) and that is around the temepat ure that a dog would wanna stay in while its sleeping , also beacuase whe n its sunny the black darkens the dog house while the dog sleeps."
26511,10,1,1,"dark gray :: I picked ths color because if it is hot day the dog wouldnt want his house black because it will just make it too hot for him, then if its white it will just be too cool for him. So I that dark gray will be just warm enough for hiom"
26512,10,2,2,"light gray ::  The best color for Brandi and Jerry to paint their dog house would probably light gray. This is because while the lid that absorbed the most heat (black) had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C and the coolest (white) had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C, the light gr ey lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C, a medium between the two, which would make the doghouse retain heat in the winter and keep it cool in the summer."
26513,10,1,1,dark gray ::  can keep warm temperature for the dog in the Winter but not so hot in the summer
26514,10,0,0,white :: IT WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE THE WHITER THE COLO R THE BETTER BEACAUSE IT WILL NOT ABSORB THAT MUCH ENRGY .
26515,10,1,1,"white :: This color would affect the doghouse because the color white reflects light, while as the color black or darker colors absorb light, so with the choice of white, the doghouse would not heat u p as much as it would if Brandi and Jerry were to use a darker color."
26516,10,2,2,"black :: This color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer. Dark colors absorb more heat energy. In the experiment w ith the jar, the air was always warmer in the jar with a black lid rather than jars with lighter color"
26517,10,0,0,black ::  This color might affect the dog house becaus e black absorbs the most energy that is given. It is shown in the results that black lid color has an average of 53(DEG)C
26518,10,1,1,light gray :: I chose light gray because it would stay cool in summer and a little warmer in the winter.
26519,10,2,2,black :: Using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter. In the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest . This would help the dog stay warmer in the winter. It would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate.
26520,10,2,2,"light gray :: The light colro of the dog house will hlp to keep the doghouse cool and ideal in hot temperatures, but will also absor b enough thermal energy from the sun to had a semi-warm environment. Whil e the black lid color in the experiment created an average jar-air temper ature of 53(DEG), that temperature is very hot and a dag would feel very uncomfortable within that environment. However, if we look at the white lid, it had an average temperature of 42(DEG). That temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is cooler. However, the light gray lid had an average of 45(DEG) in the tr ials. Its temperature was msot ideal and it would create the most balance d environmetn for the dog to live in."
26521,10,2,1,"black ::  Black would make the doghouse warm inside. In the experiment, the average temperature for black jars was 53(DEG)C"
26522,10,1,1,white :: the color white would affect the doghouse bec ause the tempuature will be cooler.
26523,10,1,1,light gray :: It would keep the dog house at a good tempera ture not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house isnt very cold.
26524,10,1,0,light gray ::  it will put some heat in but will also keep i t cool in the day
26525,10,2,2,white :: White because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun.In the experiment Brandi and Jerry discovered that darker co lors affect how much energy they can absorb. So that's why white is the b est color to choose to make a new doghouse.Because it doesn't absorb that much energy from the sun.
26526,10,2,2,"black :: Black (darker) colored paint will absorb the energy from the light source (lamp) and keep it heated up inside the dog house. Like the ""Air Temperature"" experiment, the black lid color, had 54(DEG)C while the white lid color had a 42 (DEG)C, proving that the darker the color there is, the more heat is absorbed, keeping it more warm."
26527,10,1,1,dark gray :: Dark grey would be the best color for them to make the dog house because the air temperature wouldn't be too hot or to o cold for the dog. Also the temperature stayed the same for all the tria ls which means that it won't change no matter how hot the weather may be.
26528,10,2,2,"dark gray :: I would choose to paint the doghouse dark gra y because the color would not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't mak e the doghouse too warm or cold. The data supports this because the jar w ith the dark gray lid had a temperature that was more in between that of the black and white jars, when the light gray jar had a temperature that was closer to the white jar, making it to cold."
26529,10,2,2,white ::  it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there. In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
26530,10,0,0,dark gray ::  not a lot just a agents the sun
26531,10,1,1,"white ::  It will make it warm inside the doghouse beca use the light did not penetrate it alot, so the thermometer did not go as high"
26532,10,1,1,dark gray :: it will keep it a nice temperature not too wa rm and not too cold
26533,10,0,0,white :: It wont be as hot for the dog.
26535,10,1,1,black :: the color black would effect the doghouse bec ause the sun is attracted to the color black.also in the data table the color black has the highest results on the temperture.
26536,10,2,2,"dark gray :: This color will allow the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog c omfterble. The average temperature of the Dark Gray lid was 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG) C cooler than the average temperature for the hottest lid, which was the Black lid, and therefore shows that the doghouse will be able to sustain a comt erble temperature."
26538,10,1,1,light gray ::  It will make the dog house warmer in the wint er but will not make it too warm in the summer.
26539,10,1,1,"white :: Paint the doghouse white if where you live is hot, because black attracts too much heat. Paint the doghouse black if y ou live somewhere cold because the heat can't affect that."
26540,10,2,1,"white :: White might make the doghouse cooler beacuse white, in the experiment, showed it would increase the temperature by 20 or so degrees C. When black increased by 30 or so degrees C."
26541,10,1,1,white :: i picked the white color because the affect o f white color paint makes the temperature for the dog house to be alot mo re cooler so if the dog house is white the dog's temperature will be alot more cooler than the other colors their is
26542,10,0,0,black :: the color might afferct the doghouse because mybe the dog dasent like the color they put on the dogs house or myebe is to dark or to briet for the dog. and calculate and rec ord the average air temperature for each lid color .
26543,10,2,1,"black ::  I chose black because black is going to keep the dog house warmer. If they paint the dog house white, the light will just reflect off, butt if they choose black then they will keep the warm, I know this because on the experiment they did with the lamp the average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but the average temperature with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. So black would be the best color for the dog house."
26544,10,2,1,"black :: this would make the doghouse very hot and unc omfortable because, as shown in the expirament, black attracts heat bring ing more thermal energy to the dog house than other colors such as white."
26545,10,2,2,"white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler because the black had an average of 53(DEG) C. The dar k gray had an average temperature of 48(DEG) C, and the light gray had a n average temperature of 45(DEG) C. Finally, the white had an average te mperature of 42(DEG) C. So the black jar had the highest temperature (da rkest color) and the white had the lowest temperature (brightest color). So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint"
26546,10,0,0,black :: The color black might affect the dog house be cause black is the drakest color out of the's four colors.
26547,10,1,1,white :: It should be white beacuse if its a dark color it would attract motre energy/heat.
26548,10,1,1,black ::  the black is going to make it a lot warmer in side the dog house
26549,10,1,1,white :: white because it will not tack or exorb the h eat.
26550,10,1,1,black ::  It might affect the doghouse because its a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more engery.
26551,10,2,2,black :: This color paint (Black) will attract more he at to the inside of the dog house. We know this because the averge of hea t in side the jar on Bradi and Jerry exsperiment was 54(DEG) C for black paint and 42(DEG) C for the white paint. So you can see that if you wer e wanting to keep the inside of the doghouse warm you would want to paint it black.
26552,10,1,1,black :: The color black might affect the inside of th e doghouse because if the color of the house is darker it will increase t he temp of the house inside
26553,10,1,1,black ::  it will make the temperature inside of the do ghouse hotter.
26554,10,2,2,"white :: Painting the doghouse white will make it so t hat the temperature inside will be cooler, because as tests show, white c ompared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius."
26555,10,1,1,white ::  The white color may affect the dog house by making it more cooler than solid colors because it reflects the light insted of absorbing more light energy caused form the sun.
26556,10,2,2,white :: white reflect the light. when you use white c olor temperature will lower than when you use dark color. In the expieren ce when you use white the temperature was42(DEG)C but when you use black the temperature was 53(DEG)C. When you use white color temperature was 9(DEG)C lower than when you use dark color.
26557,10,2,1,"light gray ::  In the test results the white at the average of 42(DEG)C was the coolest while black at the average of 53(DEG)C was the hottest. While light gray is averiging 45(DEG)c, it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog."
26558,10,2,2,dark gray ::  During each trial it stayed 48(DEG)C Which i snt to hot or cold. It might affect it buy whether its snowing or really cold outside he wont freeze because the color is trying to attract some k ind of heat. For when its hot It would attract some sunlight though but n ot as much as black. So its fairly compfortable for a dog.
26560,10,1,1,black :: Painting The Doghouse Black Will Result In Th e Temperature Inside To Be Higher. The Darker The Color Is On The Outside Will Absorb More Heat Energy Into The Doghouse. This Will Help Because I t Will Keep The Dog Warmer.
26561,10,1,1,black :: It would affect the doghouse because the colo r black is going to make the doghouse hotter.
26562,10,2,2,"light gray :: This color might affect the inside of the dog house because the result in the experiment was that the lighter the color the lower temperature. I chose light gray because on sunny days when the dog need shade or cooling off it can just go into the doghouse where it will be the perfect temperature; cold, but not freezing."
26563,10,0,0,black :: the color that i chose that may effect the in side of the dog house because from heat it will give the dog shade for th e dog house. from the expirement it shows when they put th e dark black lid on top of the gar it hows that the temerature decreases after they put the thermometer in the glass gar.
26564,10,0,0,black :: will absord more energy
26565,10,2,2,white :: it would be the best because it would keep th e dog cool because what had the lowest average temperature
26566,10,1,1,white :: the white absorbs less heat and keeps cooler
26567,10,2,2,"white ::  white will keep the doghouse cooler, because it will be only 42(DEG)c inside, then if Brandi and Jerry were to use black it would be 54(DEG)c inside of the doghouse because black absobes light, and white reflects the light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse."
26569,10,1,1,"light gray :: I chose the light gray because on average it was 45(DEG)C, so it wouldn't be too hot o too cold for the dog."
26571,10,0,0,white :: The color of the dog house affected the temperature inside.
26572,10,2,1,"white ::  I would chose white, because that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be really hot, id want it to be as cold as i could get it. for black the average was the wa rmest with 53(DEG)C, for dark gray it was in the middle with 48(DEG)C, for light gray it was also in the middle with 45(DEG)C, and white was the coldest wtih 42(DEG)C. The white paint will keep the doghouse less insul ated, and more open. it will keep it so its not so hot and not so cold be cause 42(DEG)C isnt cold or hot its in the middle."
26573,10,1,2,"white :: White would be the best color. this is becaus e on average it had the lowest tempature inside, so it asorbed or blocked the most heat, it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 degrees"
26574,10,1,1,black :: it would increase the temerature more than an y colors selected.
26575,10,0,0,black :: black
26576,10,2,2,white :: i think they should go with white so the dog house doesnt get to hot because the black paints number was 53 for the av erage and the litest color whites average was 42 so i think that the colo r that would be best for the dog house would be white beacuse it re flects less heat from the other three colors which were black dark gre li ght grey and white.
26577,10,1,1,white :: it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool er
26578,10,0,1,white :: because white is the the color that regects a ll light there for keeping the light rays from soaking in causing heat
26579,10,2,1,"light gray ::  The lighter the color of the doghouse, the co oler the temperature is inside, and the darker the color of the dog house , the warmer it is inside, because when the lid color was black, the aver age temperature was 53(DEG)C. But when the lid color was white, the aver age temperature was 42(DEG)C, which had a difference of 11(DEG)."
26580,10,0,0,"black :: because black is a dark color and it will atr ackt te sun, so then the tempeture is going to change"
26581,10,1,1,"light gray ::  They don't want it to be too cold, but not to o hot either. A light gray dog house won't be too cold for the dog, but a lso not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up 11(DEG)C. That isn't too much, so the dog won't suffocate, but it won't freeze to death either."
26582,10,0,1,"white ::  Assuming that you want to keep the doghouse c ool, i would choose to paint it white because it reflects the least amoun t of light."
26583,10,2,2,"black ::  The average temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C. With a dark gray lid, the average tempera ture was 48(DEG)C. With a light gray lid, the average temperature was 45 (DEG)C. With a white lid, the average temperature was 42(DEG)C. The sta rting temperature was 24(DEG)C, so the average temperature for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29(DEG)C. The average temperatur e for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11(DEG) warmer than the whit e lid. Therefore to keep the inside of the doghouse warm, and also to kee p the dog warm in cold temperatures, black would be the best color, becau se it had the highest average temperature inside the glass jar."
26584,10,1,1,"light gray :: I believe that the Light Gray color would be optimal for the doghouse. It would keep the temperature inside to a pleas ant level, not too hot or cold. The average temperature of the jar with t he Light Gray lid after ten minutes was 45(DEG) C."
26586,10,1,1,"light gray :: This color would be the best for the doghouse because if you were to use black, the dog would get really hot because t he darker the color the more energy it will attract and make it hotter. I f you use white then it doesn't get as much energy so the dog may get col d because the lighter the color the less energy you will attract. light g ray is inbetween so it will attract some energy but not to much."
26588,10,1,1,black :: the color will increase the air tempeature in side the dog house.
26589,10,1,1,white :: this would affect the dog house because in th e summer the dog would stay cool and not get hot but in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than if the dog house was black
26590,10,1,1,white ::  the inside would be cooler because dark color s absorb heat and white refects it
26593,10,0,0,black :: becouse the dog house would look filthy
26594,10,1,1,"black :: Black will affect the dog house and make it h otter, because black atracts the sun"
26595,10,0,0,dark gray ::  dark grey because their all 48in all differen t procdures
26596,10,1,2,"dark gray ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray, because it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog inside. Dark gray was the color that absorbed the second highest temperature, so the temperature will keep the dog warm, but not too hot."
26597,10,1,1,"light gray :: Light gray because it didnt heat up that much , but it did a little so the dogs house wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter"
26598,10,0,1,white :: the color should be white because so its not super duper hot when the suns out.
26599,10,1,2,"white ::  Using white to paint the doghouse will affect its temperature because it absorbs the least amount of heat from the sun , refurring back to the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment, we know that whi te absorbs the least amount of heat because in all 3 trials, the average amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was 42(DEG) after 10 minutes, t hat is only 18(DEG)C more than the temperature it started at (24(DEG) C). This is how we would know which paint to use for the dog house."
26600,10,2,2,"black ::  the color black will make a higher temperature in the dog house then dark gray light gray, or white because darker colors absorb more energy. this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp. the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis, the average temperature for the dark gray lid inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, the a verage temperature for the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 m inutes was 45 degrees celsuis, and the average temperature inside the gla ss jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 42 degrees celsuis. this da ta shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the do g house."
26602,10,1,1,black :: it will make the dog house really hot.
26603,10,2,2,"black ::  By using black for the color of the dog house , the inside of the house will be warmer than the other colors, because d arker colors absorb more heat. According to Brandi and Jerry's chart it i s true, because after 10 minutes the black lit had the warmest air inside the jar."
26604,10,1,0,dark gray ::  it will keep same temp. and will be too hot nor cold
26605,10,1,1,black ::  It will make the doghouse warmer inside which would be good for the winter time so the dog isnt cold and miserable.
26606,10,1,1,white ::  the color will affect the dog house because i t will make it alot cooler in the dog house when the sun is out and it wi ll look better(:
26607,10,0,0,white ::  they paint the color whit because it at tracts less sun light.
26608,10,1,1,white ::  white paint color because that way the dog wo nt be hot instead it would be cool
26610,10,0,0,light gray ::  eeee
26611,10,1,1,"black :: If the doghouse is black, it will absorb more energy then the other colors. This is apparent in the test, where the st arting temperature for the glass jar was 24(DEG) C, and the black jar we nt up to 53(DEG) C, while the white jar only went up to 42(DEG) C."
26612,10,1,1,light gray :: It will make it slighty cooler than hot. It w ill affect the dog house as making the dog house warm on cold days and not to hot on hot days.
26613,10,1,1,white ::  That color would allow the doghouse to be coo ler and not so hot and stuffy.
26614,10,1,1,white :: white because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as dark lids.
26615,10,2,2,"light gray :: The color of light gray might affect the dog house by keeping it the right temprature (not too cold or too hot) becaus e the darker the color the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the c ooler it gets, according too the data in which i got the information."
26616,10,1,1,white :: the wite color will make the dog house cooler so it wont be hot and stuffy.
26617,10,1,1,black :: If you had a dog house black then all the the rmal enegy will go to it and be warmer for your dog. Inside the dog house would be warm for your dog to live in. As it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture.
26618,10,1,1,white :: if the dog house was painted black and was exposed to the sun for to long it would get to ht.now if it was painted white the house wont get to hot
26619,10,1,1,dark gray :: dark gray because the temperature wont be to hot or to cold it would be just the right temperature for the dog.
26620,10,1,1,light gray ::  The light gray only attracts 45 degrees celci us and that is pretty warm. During the winter the dog won't freeze and du ring the summer it won't sweat a lot.
26622,10,1,1,white :: white because if not you could over heat the dog yu want to keep it cool
26623,10,2,2,"white ::  A white paint on the dog house might work the best for summer and according to the data table, the white color's avera ge temperature was the lowest so it will be good for days when it's hot."
26626,10,1,1,white ::  it would make it cooler inside because white reflects the sun rays and black absorbs them.
26628,10,2,2,light gray :: The best color to paint a doghouse would be l ight gray because according to the selection light gray was cooler than b lack by 8(DEG) and it was 3(DEG) hotter than white which would allow th e dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter
26630,10,2,2,"white :: White paint would be best because it would ke ep the interior of the dog house cool. The white lid had an average of 42 (DEG) C while the black lid got up to 53(DEG) C. Unless you want your d og to be too hot in his or her doghouse, I suggest you paint it white. Al so, white looks much better on houses than black, dark grey, or light gre y."
26631,10,1,1,dark gray ::  the dark gray might effect the iside by the temputer because the starting temputer in the exsperiment was 24 degrees and it ended up being 48 degrees each time
26632,10,2,2,light gray :: Using a light gray paint on a dog house will help keep it warm inside on cold days and cool inside on warm days so the dog is always comfortable. I would pick light gray for the color because it had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C inside the glass jar and that is a nice even temperature for cold and warm days.
26633,10,1,1,"black :: They should paint the dog house black because that on avergage had the highest temperature of 53(DEG)C. Which was 5(DEG) C higher than the second warmest roof color of Dark Gray and 11(DEG)C higher t han the coldest roof color, white."
26634,10,1,1,dark gray :: it wont be too hot or too cold.
26635,10,0,0,dark gray :: dark gray
26636,10,2,2,"dark gray :: The white paint would reflect all of the ligh t rays, therefore keeping the dog house cooler for the dog to escape the heat. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG) C air temperature in side the jar after 10 minutes, but the white lid had and average of 42(DEG) C air temperature inside the jar, after 10 minutes. This is a difference of 11 (DEG) C. The white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other colo r of paint."
26637,10,2,2,"white ::  The color White will affect the dog house, by in the summer when it is hotter outside the white wont absorbe to much h eat, keeping the dog house cooler. The average temperature for the Whute lip was 42 (the coolest temperater) And the average for black was 53 (the highest) the lower the number the cooler it is. White would be the best choice for the doghouse."
26638,10,1,1,black ::  Black is the best color because it increases the air temperature so the dog won't be cold.
26639,10,2,2,"light gray :: Using Light Gray would keep the tempurature a t an even or equal rate. If it was cold, it wouldn't keep it as warm, but not super cold either. If it was hot outside, the dog house would keep s orta cool, but not extremely hot either. The average of Black is a high a t 53 degrees. which is super hot. Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees."
26641,10,1,1,"light gray :: Light gray might affect the doghouse because it will absorb enery, making the inside warm for the dog. Since the color doesn't absorb all of the energy, the doghouse will still be cool compar ed to having the paint black and keeping all of the energy in. Light gray paint will absorb only a certain amount of energy."
26642,10,1,1,black :: white because it was less heat in 10min. Also the temputers only got to around 40- 45(DEG)
26643,10,1,1,light gray :: Light gray because it would keep the dog hous e warm and still a little bit cool for the dogs temperature. The temperat ure stays to an average of 45(DEG) C.
26644,10,2,1,white :: white paint will keep the inside of the dodho use cool because in their expirment the tempature of the white was 42(DEG) c it will keep the dog comfortable.
26646,10,0,0,white :: dark colors will seem confusing just keep it white
26647,10,2,2,"white ::  Brandi and Jerry should design a doghouse wit h the color white, because the white lid's average air temperature i n the jar was only 42(DEG) C, the lowest temperature of all the lids. Th is would make the doghouse have a lower temperature when exposed to light , to keep the dog cooler. As you can see the average air temperature in the jar for the white lid was only 42(DEG) C as compared to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. This is an increase in 11(DEG) C a clear in crease of air temperature in the jar from the white to the black lid, and therefore showing that with the white paint the air temperature within t he doghouse when exposed to light will be the lowest compared to all othe r paint colors tested."
26648,10,1,2,"white :: The color will reflect most of the heat and t he inside of the doghouse will stay cooler. In the experament, the temper ature of the jar with the white lid only was raised an average of 16(DEG) C."
26649,10,2,2,"white :: By painting the doghouse white, the temperatu re in the doghouse will not be that high. according to the experiment, us ing a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low. so by paint ing the doghouse white, the temperature in the doghouse will stay low."
26651,10,1,1,white ::  The best color for the doghouse will be white because of the results both Brandi and Jerry did white seem to be the color that is way more cooler than any other colors by this I mean in average tempeture for the color white was 42(DEG) C which means that the dog will feel freash being inside the doghouse every day it not to cold but not to warm either.
26652,10,1,1,light gray ::  black holds heat in so it would be to hot and white hardly holds any heat.so light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling.
26653,10,2,2,"light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their dog house light gray because it won't absorb as much heat/energy as the darker colors. In the data is shows that the black lid got the hottest (53(DEG) C) , while the light gray lid only reached 45(DEG) C. It will still collect heat to keep the doghouse warm but not as much as the darker colors."
26656,10,0,0,white :: It won't effect it at all becuase white don't asorb to much energy and won't cuase any heat like black will
26657,10,1,1,black :: if they use the darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it will be warm.
26658,10,2,2,"white :: The paint color that they should use is white . This is because the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG), while the average temperatures for the other colors were 45, 48, and 53(DEG) . This shows that the white lid was 11(DEG) degrees color on average than the black lid. Therefore, the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in t he white house, wheras he could become too hot in the black one."
26659,10,1,2,light gray :: It wont make the dog hot or cold because it's in between.The highest tempature would be to hot because its 54(DEG) an d the lowest would be to cold which is 41(DEG) and light gray is in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot or cold.
26660,10,0,1,"black :: If the dog house had a black roof, it would benefit the dog in all kinds of weather. For example, in the winter time or when it is cold out, the black roof keeps all of the dog's body heat in the house, instead of wasting it. And in the summer, when it's hot, he'll be outside playing, and his doghouse temperature won't matter that much ."
26661,10,1,1,black :: It would make the doghouse warmer.
26663,10,0,0,light gray ::  You dont want the dog to hot so make it so it will be cooler inside. It will be about 45(DEG)C
26665,10,1,1,white :: white because it holds the least amount of he at.
26666,10,0,0,"light gray :: Well ,I pick Light gray because I wouldnt wan t too much energy in my dogs house if i had to pick a color . Most dogs g oes in their house soo they can either cool off or to relax ."
26667,10,0,1,"light gray :: Light gray will be the best color to paint fo r the dog house, because it wouldn't attract a lot of heat like the color black and dark gray would."
26668,10,0,0,dark gray :: The light grey color of the dog house would m ake it nuetral inside because it stayed the same throughout each experime nt.
26669,10,1,1,black :: The sun absorbs more energy in the color. Mak ing the inside of the doghouse hot &amp; warm.
26671,10,2,2,"black :: if they painted the doghouse black, then it w ill be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb. example: the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar."
26672,10,1,1,white :: The best color to paint a doghouse is white because white keeps the doghouse less warmer
26673,10,1,1,black :: a black doghouse will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold. a white dog house will make it colder than all of the oth er colors.
26674,10,1,1,white :: the darker the color is the hotter it will be inside. the lighter the color is it will not be as no t inside.
26676,10,2,2,"white :: white will, attract less heat. i say this bec ause, it had the lowest average of 42(DEG) thats 1(DEG) less than gray, 6(DEG) less that dark grey, and 11(DEG) less than black."
26677,10,1,1,light gray ::  well if the color is to dark then the doghous e would be to hot so use a color the might not make the dohouse to
26678,10,0,0,black :: i think black would be the best for the color of a dog house because darker color aborb more energy and black is the d arkest one
26679,10,0,0,"dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should pant their doghouse d ark gray. I think they should paint the doghouse dark g ray because in the experiment Hot Lamp the average of the averages in tha t experiment was 57, and the closest temperature of the averages in that experiment is the dark gray lid."
26680,10,0,0,white :: because in the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i picked white cause different chemical.
26681,10,2,2,white ::  The color white will affect the dog house by changing the temperature and making it much cooler in the dog house . In the experiment it showed that the color white was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 42 when black was 53C
26682,10,1,1,black ::  The color will keep the doghouse temperature warmer. The black color will absorb the heat of the day and keep the dogh ouse warm at night.
26683,10,1,1,white :: White would be the best because then the dog would not get too hot.
26684,10,2,2,black :: The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse. This is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53(DEG) C and when the Lid color was White the air temperature inside was only an avera ge of 42(DEG)C. So this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11(DEG)C.
26685,10,2,2,"black :: In the expirement, the jar with the black lid was on average 53(DEG)C after being exposed to the lamp for ten minuets . The dark grey lid was only 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C less than that of the bl ack lid. The jar with a white lid was only 42(DEG)C, 11(DEG)C less than the jar with the black lid. To warm up the dog house by just the sunligh t Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house black to increase the tempe rature within the dog house. Compared to the results with the jars, the b lack paint would absord the sunlight and warm up the dog house more than painting it white as with the jars expirement, the black lid warmed up th e jar 11(DEG)C more than the jar with the white lid."
26686,10,2,2,"white :: I would choose white because, white does not absorb a lot of light so there for, when iit is hot outside your dog will not get to hot inside of its doghouse. I choose the color white because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the white lid was 42 and for the Black lid it was 53. that is an 11(DEG)c difference between the two colors. So for a dog house I highly considered it being w hite."
26687,10,2,2,light gray :: The light gray will make the dogs house not t oo cold and not too hot for the dog. The average tempature would probably be around 40-50(DEG) because the light gray lid on the jar had an avera ge 45(DEG) C but a dog house is a different size from a jar so the tempa ture will vary a little.
26688,10,2,2,white ::  The best color for the dog house is white. This is because acording to Brandies and Jerrys experiment the white dog house gives the least amount of heat into the dog house. For the Black dog house the average temperature would be 53(DEG)C for the Dark Grey dog house the average temperature would be 48(DEG)C for the Light Grey dog house the teperature would be 45(DEG)C and the White dog house would have a temerature 42(DEG)C. Acording to this data the best color for a dog house would be white.
26689,10,1,1,white :: If the dark the color the hotter it gets why not choose white to keep the dog nice and cool in some ways.
26690,10,0,0,white :: White is the best color for the dog house bec ause darker colors absorb more heat when its warm or hot out. But white r eflects all of that heat energy
26691,10,2,2,"dark gray :: The reason that I selected dark gray as the o ptimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors, dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature. This tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it, and c ooler then black in the summer, because it is a lighter shade than black. This will occur from the dark gray paint, because in the experiment, the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53(DEG). The use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42(DEG). The use of a light gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45(DEG), and the u se of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48(DEG). T his shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature, and ideal for a dogho use, because its tempurature was 6(DEG) hotter than the coolest tempurat ure, and 5(DEG) cooler then the hottest tempurature, making dark gray me dium in tempurature, and optimal for a dog house."
26692,10,1,1,"dark gray :: That color (dark gray) might affect the dog h ouse by absorbing heat cause it is a dark color,but not as dark black,so it won't absorb so munch heat."
26693,10,2,2,white :: The best paint color for the dog house is whi te because the white color for the lid does not get as hot as the other c olor so itt wont be really hot inside the dog house. Acording to the Air Temperature BLACK average was 53 C(DEG) DARK GRAY average 48 C(DEG) LIG HT GRAY average 45 C(DEG) And the WHITE average 42 C(DEG)
26694,10,1,1,white :: i picked white because it will make the dog h ouse colder even when the sun hits it
26695,10,2,2,"white ::  I would choose to paint the dog house white. The reason that I would paint the dog house white is because the inside o f the dog house would then be cooler, rather than if you were painting it black. The average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42(DEG)C rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53(DEG)C . This has an overwhelming difference of 11(DEG)C after JUST 10 minutes"
26696,10,2,2,"black ::  This color (black) will help the dog house stay/become warmer. Since the dog house is outside, and for the most part its pretty cold outside, the dog house should be black, so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm. Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees Celcius. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees Celcius. So this proves that the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb, making the object warmer."
26697,10,0,0,black :: the color will keep the dog house cooler in t he hot sumer
26698,10,1,1,dark gray ::  dark gray because it will attrac enough heat to keep it warm in the dog house.
26699,10,0,0,white :: I pick this color because its so bright.
26700,10,0,0,"dark gray ::  The color wuld keep the dog house at a even t empature but it wouldnt really matter because its not a closed system. th e jar had a lid so it left in heat ,but a dog house would let the heat ou t so the dog house is a open system."
26701,10,2,2,"white :: The tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside. Because in the experimen t, the results from all the testing showed that the white colored lid was much cooler the the rest of the colors used, so it would be more reasona ble to use the white colored paint to paint the doghouse."
26702,10,1,1,light gray :: it will keep it warm in the winter but in the summer it would keep it cool because it is a light gray
26704,10,2,2,"light gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be light grey. This because the light grey would keep the dog house not a s hot during like the summer, and warm enough during the winter. From Bra ndi and Jerry's previous experiment, you can see with darker colors on th e lids like black and dark grey it made the jar temperature hotter so if you used it on the dog house it would make it too warm inside. With the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold. Another choice would be the whi te but that might make the dog house to cold in the winter, so light grey is the best choice."
26705,10,1,1,white ::  it asorb less heat
26706,10,1,1,"black :: the color would keep the dog house warmer bec use the average was 53 minutes after the light was turned off, so the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 min utes after the light turned off."
26709,10,2,2,"black :: The color black, might affect the inside of t he doghouse because the color black absorbs more energy compared to the o ther colors. I think this because in the data from the experiment, the av erage air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black was 53(DEG)C. The Dark gray lid colors average air temperatu re inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 48(DEG)C, the air temperat ure for light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the average air temperature for the lid color white was 42(DEG)C. Overall, the conclusion you could draw fr om that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energy than the other colors. In the experiment the black lid had a difference in average s from the coldest air temperature (the white lid) by 11(DEG)C."
26710,10,0,0,light gray :: maybe something else was alredy that color
26712,10,0,1,light gray :: they would choose light gray because they want the dog house to be the right tempature for the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect temapture for the dog.
26713,10,1,1,white :: That color will effect the doghouse because t he doghouse will not be hot in the summer it will stay cool in the there.
26714,10,1,1,black ::  black if you live in a cold place and want th e dog house to stay warm.
26717,10,1,1,"white ::  i choose white because if it was black,dark g ray, or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hot ness."
26718,10,0,0,dark gray :: Because dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house?
26719,10,0,0,black :: the color might affect the dog house because it is a dark color.....
26721,10,1,1,black :: Black would be a good because it is a dark co lor and dark colors absorbe heat so when the dog house is made it will be warm for the dog.
26722,10,0,0,white :: white
26723,10,0,0,dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best for the lids to m ake it sleeping light
26724,10,1,1,"light gray ::  light gray is not too cold but not too hot . Remember , most dogs have alot of hair on their bodys to keep them warm. &amp; so you dont want a dog house that gets too hot , like the black dog house , cause the sun obsorbs in darker colors. If a dog gets too col d in the dog house , provide blankets , food , &amp; water . For a health y envoirment. Also , if you see its a nice day outside , let the dog play aroud dont make it get cooped up inside ."
26725,10,1,1,"white :: If you painted the dog house white, it would keep the dog cooler than if you were to paint the dog house black because the color black attracts heat more than the color white does, so if you painted it black, the dog would be really warm."
26727,10,1,1,"light gray :: You'd probably want a light gray so that in t he summer the house is cool, and in the winter its warm"
26729,10,1,1,"light gray :: Light gray doesnt wont make the dog house, to o hot or too cold. The dog house would be both warm and cool down."
26730,10,0,0,dark gray ::  Dark gray is best because the temperature sta ys the same
26732,10,1,1,dark gray :: I would say dark gray because if it was cold it would keep the doghouse warm and if it was hot the doghouse wold be wa rm inside.
26733,10,1,1,dark gray :: cause darker the color more it atracts heat
26734,10,2,2,"light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse li ght grey, because light grey absorbs more heat than white, but it absorbs less heat than black and dark grey. Light gray would be perfect, because during the summer, the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot, s o the doghouse would'nt be too warm. During the winter, the light gray wo uld absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the win ter. I know this because in the experiment that Brandi and Jerry did (whe re they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature) the y found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53(DEG)C. The average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48(DEG)C. The average temper ature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45(DEG) C. Finnaly, the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42(DEG)C. This shows that light gray absorbs some heat, bu t not alot, so Light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse."
26735,10,1,1,"white :: If the color white is used on the dog house, it would reflect the suns light causing the inside of the dog house to be cooler than if it was painted with a darker colored paint."
26736,10,1,1,white :: white would best fit the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm.
26737,10,2,2,dark gray ::  The dark gray would be better for the dog hou se because its not to hot but not to cold. The black would be to ho t becuse the average was 53(DEG)c but the light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45(DEG)c and white at 42 (DEG)c. So in this case the dark gray is the right color fot the dog house with the average of 48(DEG)c.
26738,10,0,0,black :: how hot it will get
26739,10,0,1,white ::  I go with white because then the dog wont be as hot or cold in somedays because most of the trials were different.
26741,10,2,2,"black :: Black will be a good color for the dog house because it attracts heat and it will kep the dog warm in its dog house. T he average temperature for the color black is 53 degrees and the average temperature for the lightest color, white, is 42 degrees, though black is better because it is a warmer color and the dog should rather be warm ra ther than cold."
26743,10,1,1,white :: the darker the coler the hotter the air in th e dog house
26744,10,1,1,white :: White would be a good color for the dog house because it doesn't absorb as much heat as black. This would make it cool er so the dog wouldn't be too hot
26745,10,2,2,"black :: If it is cold outside and there is still some sun, the color would absorb the sun, making the dog house a little warme r for the dog to stay in. Giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing. Brandi and Jerry did an experiment wh ere they tested colors (black, dark gray, light gray &amp; white) and bla ck had an average of 53 degrees C. While comparing to the white which was 42 degrees C, that is 12 degrees apart from the black."
26746,10,1,1,dark gray :: it would keep the doghouse warm but not to wa rm because dark gray is a dark color
26747,10,1,1,white :: i think that white would effect the dog house because it had the lowest numbers in the data table
26750,10,2,1,white :: the daog have fur and when it hot the white w ill reflect the heat from going inside and keep the dog cool in the exper iment the white got cool then the others
26752,10,2,2,black ::  If the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer. The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it. the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse.
26753,10,0,0,"dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house because in all the trials the dark gray lid changed the air temperature in the jar to 48(DEG)C. The light gray lid change the air in the jar to 44(DEG)C in the first trial, 45(DEG)C in the second trial, and 46(DEG)C in the third trial. Dark gray would kepp the doghouse the s ame temperature where as the light grays temperature would vary."
26755,10,1,1,black ::  it will make the air inside the dog house war mer if the color is darker
26757,10,1,1,"white ::  white would be the best choice for the dog ho use because dark colors like black and dark gray absorb a lot of energy a nd it will be hotter, so therefor make a white doghouse and the dog would be in cooler temp"
26758,10,1,1,"light gray ::  Well darker colors absorb more heat,making the dog house a lighter color will keep it cool,but also warm but not to warm"
26759,10,2,2,"white :: white because, the jar with the white jar lid stayed the coolest and only got up to about 42(DEG)c. so the dog house would stay cooler if you painted it white."
26760,10,1,1,black :: black will affect the dog house becouse black attracts the sun wich makes lots of heat and high temperature
26761,10,0,1,black :: Becasue darker colors absorve more enrg y .
26762,10,1,1,black :: black because dark colors absorb more energy
26763,10,1,1,white :: because thee adrker the color of something th e more heat is attracted to it.
26764,10,1,1,"light gray :: Its the median tempurature from the experimen t, so the doghouse temurature would be able to stay warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather."
26765,10,1,1,"light gray :: The color will keep the dog warmer in the win ter, but won't make the dog house hot in the summer."
26767,10,2,2,black ::  Black paint well keep the doghouse warmer because the black lid was avaraged 54(DEG)C ware as white paint was only 42(DEG)C. So there would be an avarge of about 12(DEG)C diffence b etween the white and black paint.
26768,10,2,2,"black ::  the darker the color, the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer. and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest. the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse"
26769,10,0,1,"dark gray :: This color will effect the tempeture of the d og house because the tempeture doesnt change most of the time. the dark g ray color keeps the tempeture the same, and it keeps it nice and cool for the dog."
26770,10,0,0,light gray ::  black is too dark and it will make the dog de peress and the white is too light it will be dirty so soon so gray color will not make it dirty soon and depress. it will make the dog hyper and m ore excited.
26771,10,1,1,dark gray :: because it gives the inside of the doghouse a warm felling inside that would confret the dog
26772,10,2,2,white ::  The color white would be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other color choices. The average temperature when testing white paint in the experiment was 42(DEG) C. Which is 11(DEG)C cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average of 53(DEG)C. Proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best choice.
26773,10,0,0,"black :: it will make it absorb more enerrgy ,"
26774,10,2,1,dark gray ::  the color dark gray because it would keep the dog house cool for the dog because the average temp. was 48(DEG)
26775,10,2,2,white :: The white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside. Since the temperature was lowest when the white lid wa s on the jar the temperature in the doghouse will be cooler with a white doghouse.
26776,10,2,2,"white :: Because it does'nt get as hot at black, dark grey, or light gray, the avrage for the white lid is 42(DEG)c, the avera ge for the black is 53(DEG)c, the average for the dark grey is 48(DEG)c , and the average for the light grey is 45(DEG)c so there for white is t he best color for the dog house because it doesnt get as hot as the other colors"

26778,10,0,0,white :: well dogs like light color so they will use i t more often.
26779,10,1,1,"white ::  White might be the best color for the doghous e because of its low heat intake. With the dog having long hair it wouldn't be the best decision to have aa black doghlouse where it would a lways get hot. So, with a white doghouse the dog could be more comfortabl e in a less hot doghouse."
26780,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  If Brandi and Jerry made a doghouse, the best color to paint it would be dark gray. Dark gray would be best because it absorbs heat so the dog won't be cold if it goes inside, but it isn't as dark as black so if the dog wants to be cooler, it can use the doghouse."
26781,10,0,0,"dark gray :: The dog house would not be too hot in the sum mer if you did a dark gray, also if you chose a light gray it could be co ld in the winter, so there for dark gray would be the best color."
26783,10,1,1,white :: The color white may affect the dog house beca use during the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white refflects the sun. Making the dog house less hot.
26784,10,2,2,white :: the average air temperature of the jar with a white lid was 41(DEG)C. with the paint color as white the air temperatu re in the doghouse won't get as hot. With a black lid in the previous exp eriment the average air temperature was 53(DEG)C which is hotter than th e white lid by 12(DEG)C.
26785,10,1,1,light gray ::  so it won't get to hot or too cold
26786,10,0,0,white ::  It woulod affect the temperature inside of it .
26787,10,1,1,white ::  because it is said to no contract heat or ab sorb
26788,10,0,0,white :: i chose white cause it is the lightest color out of all fur of them and the other ones will just attract heat and the sun.
26789,10,1,1,"light gray :: it would affect the dog house by keeping it cool. A dog that is active and does a lot of running, the dog would not want to got to a doghouse that is painted black because that would attract a lot of heat to the point where the dog would stay too hot to cool off."
26790,10,1,1,black :: it would keep the dog house warm becaus e the color will atract the heat wich will keep the house warm.
26791,10,1,1,"white ::  This color won't make the doghouse to hot, to the highest temperature. The temperature of the white doghouse will be just right on a dog, especially after more than 10 minutes."
26794,10,1,1,"dark gray :: The darker a color is the more heat energy it attracts, so the dark grey would attract not much heat energy to where its to hot, but it wont be to cold either."
26795,10,1,1,"dark gray :: I think dark gray would be the best color for the dog house because out of all the other colors, this was the only one with the same temperature throughout the trials. it wouldn't be too cold or too hot."

26797,10,1,1,white :: white will keep the dog house cold.
26798,10,2,2,"white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because the lighter the color is the less light it will attract.The reason black,dark grey,or light grey wouldn't work is in the table it shows for the averages, black is 53 and that is just to high,dark gray is 48 and that is also pretty warm,light gray is 45 and that is a little cooler th an the dark gray but noy much,and then it shows white,and white is 42 and that was the coolest of all the colrs bucause is attracted less heat."
26799,10,2,2,"white :: by painting the doghouse white it would make the doghouse cooler inside than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the data it shows that the average temperature of the air in the jar that had the white lid was 42(DEG)c , and the average temprature for the air inside the jar that had the black lid was 53(DEG)c. by painting the doghouse white there would be a difference in heat of 11(DEG)c t han painting the doghouse black. therefore painting the doghouse white would be the best choice of color to paint the doghouse because it would keep it the coolist temperature."

26801,10,2,2,"black ::  I think the black paint would work best becau se it absorbed the most heat out of the four colors. The average temperat ure was 53 degrees which was five degrees higher than the dark gray, eigh t degrees higher than the light gray, and eleven degrees higher than the white paint."
26803,10,2,2,white :: the white paint would make the inside of the dog house cool and not hot becuse dark colors absorb more energy as said in the text and bright colors don't.
26804,10,1,1,white ::  The white would make it cooler inside so in t he summer it wouldn't be hot
26805,10,2,2,"white ::  You should use white because the dog probibly has enough fur to last through winer so you would want to keep as much h eat out as possible during the summer-I say this because according to the test reasults the average air heat from black was 53(DEG)C, the average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C, The average for light gray was 45(DEG)C an d the average for white was 42(DEG)C. So in conclution the white paint i s 11(DEG)C cooler than black paint. -"
26806,10,1,1,white ::  White has the least air temperature (42) and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse.

26819,10,1,1,light gray :: Its a lighter color and then it wont be that hot.
26820,10,2,2,"black ::  Black would be the best choice in colder clim ates (Washington) because it absorbs more heat. The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black. Inside the jars, blacks av erage temperature is 53(DEG)C, compared with white which's average tempe rature was 42(DEG)C. That is a difference of 11(DEG)C."
26821,10,2,2,"black ::  If you use the color black, then the inside o f the doghouse will have an increase in temperature. According to the exp eriment a Black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. While t he white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. Therefore I can conc lude that a darker color will cause an object to have a higher tempature. Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse."

26824,10,2,2,black :: In the experiment the black lid made the air hotter so to make the doghouse hot they should use the black lid for the lamp.
26825,10,1,1,black ::  because in the winter the dog has a beter chance of staying warm
26826,10,1,1,white ::  White will not affect the doghouse because th e sun will not go to the doghouse as black because black absoed more the energy so the godhouse will get hot as much as the coloer black.
26827,10,0,1,"white :: Having a white painted roof will reflect heat in the summer, so the dog will not overheat inside it."
26828,10,2,2,white ::  Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler. This is because white is a color that doesn't absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog. In the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11(DEG)c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler.

26834,10,2,2,black :: Black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53(DEG) c. The white will will not make it as hot because it's average temperatur e was 42(DEG)c.
26835,10,2,2,dark gray ::  I think that they should paint the dog house black because it absorbs more sunlight and allow the house to be warmer. The black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white on e had 41 degrees.
26836,10,1,1,"white ::  white, might make it colder in the winter tha n the spring ,black might it hot in the summer and winter the light gray as well"
26837,10,1,1,"white ::  Since white is such a light color it doesnt a bsorb so much energy and it's cooler than the other colors. Cooler condit ions are best for a dog, in my opinion."
26839,10,2,2,"white ::  White paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color. In the experiment, the white color had the lowest temperature, after 10 minutes, and was 42(DEG)C. The light gray was 45(DEG)C, the dark gray was 48(DEG)C, and the black was 53(DEG)C. Since the white had the lowest temperature, it would keep the doghouse coolest, and therefore be the best to use."
26841,10,0,0,white ::  because the whit well not be as heated in the dog house unlike black because that welll heat the whole doghouse
26843,10,2,2,"dark gray :: The color might affect the doghouse by making the inside temmperature warmer than the temperature outside by more than it would if you used white, or light grey. because in the experiment, th e dark grey absorbed more heat, getting an average of 48 degrees C. compa red to light grey's 45 degrees and whites 42. Black absorbs more energy, at about 53 degrees C., but the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house during the summer."
26844,10,1,1,white :: because if u have a lighter color then the temperture would be colder
26846,10,0,0,"light gray :: If darker colors absorb more heat, then I'm g uessing that that means it absorbs cold temperatures too. So to keep it a t an even balance, I would say the color light gray is the best choice."
26847,10,2,2,"black :: Painting the dog house black would make the a ir inside it warmer. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment, the average air te mperate of the can with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, whereas the dark gray was only 48(DEG)C, the light gray was only 45(DEG)C, and the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Therefore, the black lid made the air the warmest so a doghouse painted black will have the warmest inner temperature."
26848,10,2,2,"white ::  If the color of the doghouse is white, then i t would be colder inside the dog house and when it is warm and sunny outs ide the dog in the doghouse will not get to hot. The results from the exp eriment support my desicion because in the experiment with a white lid th e temperature inside the glass jar was 42(DEG)C and all the other temper ature averages were a higher temperature than 42(DEG)C."
26849,10,1,2,"dark gray :: In the experiment, the dark gray lid made the air temperature inside the jar an average of 48(DEG)(c). If the doghous e was black the air temperature would be an average of 53(DEG)(c). If th e doghouse was white the average temperature would be 42(DEG)(c). If the doghouse was dark gray then the dog wouldn't be too hot or too cold."
26850,10,1,1,"black ::  It would affect it by making the dog house more warm when the sun is out. The reason I would use this color is because when its cold outside during the day, the black will absorb more energy from the sun and make it warmer for the dog."
26851,10,1,1,black :: in the daytime the dog house will be warmer
26852,10,0,0,white :: This color through off more heat than the res t of them.
26853,10,1,1,white :: This color might affect the doghouse because the doghouse might stay cool for the dog and they wont burn up in the dar k colors.
26855,10,1,1,white ::  i would choose white because you don't want t he dog to get too warm.
26856,10,1,1,black :: that color might affect the dog house because it will keep the dogs warm at night in case of the cold air. for example if it was hot and i was wearing black i would be hot as well cause its a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in t he air.
26858,10,1,1,"light gray :: It will asorb some heat into the dog house, s o that the dog could stay warm at most times."
26859,10,2,2,"white ::  If the doghouse was painted white, in the sum mer when it was very hot outside, then the dog would be able to go into t he doghouse where it would be cool inside. I know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures. The ligh ter the color, the cooler it will be inside."
26860,10,1,0,dark gray :: it will make the doghouse cold and look dark even during the day.
26861,10,0,0,black :: bacause its black
26864,10,2,2,"white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because it attracts the less heat in the trials the tempatures we re 42(DEG), 43(DEG), 41(DEG), and 42(DEG) which makes it the lowest t empatures out of all the colors"
26865,10,1,1,"black ::  it might effect it,by using this color it can make the doghouse more warmer on summer days."
26866,10,1,1,white ::  well when it gets hot in the summer the dog w ill be cooler and white goes with everything.
26867,10,0,0,white :: white would reflect heat so the dog would not get verry hot
26868,10,0,0,light gray :: they might not beabol to see the thing
26870,10,2,2,"white :: White, because you want your dog to be cool e nough and according to the ""Lid color vs. Air tempature inside glass jar"" chart, white is the coolest."
26871,10,2,2,"dark gray ::  I think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside, than if it was a lighter or darker color. I think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53(DEG), dark grey was the second warmest at 48(DEG), light grey was next at 45(DEG), and white was least warmest at 42(DEG)."
26872,10,2,2,"white :: I would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool. In the experiment, the jar with the white lid was an average temperature of 42(DEG)C and the jar with the bl ack lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C."
26873,10,2,2,"white ::  They should make the dog house with a white r oof because that will keep the inside of the dog house cool, instead of e xtremely hot. In their experiment the average for a white lid was 42(DEG) C, as apposed to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. It would be a lot smarter to keep the inside of the doghouse cool by using white paint so the dog has some where to cool off, instead of using black paint so i t is very hot in the dog house and the dog will not want to be inside of the dog house at all."
26874,10,1,1,black ::  because when is sunny the inside the doghouse is going to be so hot
26876,10,2,2,"black :: If they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm. As in the experiment it shows that when they used the b lack lid, the temperature went from 24(DEG)C to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. And when they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24(DEG)C to 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This showes that the darker the color, the great er increase in the air temperature, because the darker colors absorb more energy."
26877,10,1,1,dark gray :: it would effect it because in the doghouse it wouldn't be too hot and it woul dn't be to cold.
26878,10,1,1,white :: the color white would keep the dog house at a cooler temperature
26880,10,1,1,black ::  black would affect the doghouse because if it was to hot the dog wouldnt have know where to go but the doghouse the the dog house would be extremely hot
26881,10,1,1,dark gray :: Dark gray because that color doesnt absorb to much sun to make it hot and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it t o cold.It absorbs just the right amount of sun so that its not to hot and not to cold.
26882,10,0,0,black :: blach dontueist nating
26884,10,1,0,dark gray :: the color wont absorb to much heat therfore i t wont be to hot inside. the darker the color the greater the heat
26885,10,1,1,"white ::  You would want to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much heat as daker colors would, therefor; keeping the dog cooler in the summer time."
26886,10,2,2,"white :: In the trails, the white lid got the least ho t, so the dog house does not get to hot, they should paint it white."
26888,10,1,1,white ::  reflect more heat to keep the inside cooler i n the sumer
26889,10,2,2,black :: Black would change the temperature of the dog house by making it warmer beacause black absorbs heat to most. With the black lid the temperture was 53(DEG)C. With the white lid the temperature was 42(DEG)C. There was 11(DEG)C difference.
26890,10,2,2,white :: i would say white because in the experiment t he darker the color the hotter it got. And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot.
26891,10,0,0,white :: Because dog likes to touch things so they mit e do something and make the lamp fall.
26892,10,0,1,white :: it would be the color that would attract the least amount of heat
26893,10,0,0,dark gray ::
26894,10,2,1,"black :: the color black will affect the dog house in many ways. for example, it will be warm in there when its sunny out side. the way that i know this is, the temp of the black lid is 54 digres then 52 digres then back to 54 digres so the average temp is 53 digres but fo r white the average temp was 42 so as you can see this is how the color o f the doghouse affects the temp it will be warm in the doghouse."
26895,10,1,1,"light gray ::  The color light gray would have to be the be st color to paint the doghouse. They wouldnt want to use black because si nce black is a dark color itll absorb more energy &amp; make the air temp erature rise high. So black wouldnt be a good color because they wouldnt want the dogs to get to hot. That is why i chose light gray because i thi nk its just righ to paint the doghouse. With light gray, the dogs wouldnt be to hot or too cold. They would be just right."
26896,10,0,0,dark gray :: when it rains or gets cold the doghouse will be warm and if it hot our the dog can be in some shade
26898,10,1,1,light gray :: it is not too hot or too cold
26899,10,1,1,"dark gray :: It might affect the doghouse by adding heat , but not too much heat and the temperature will stay the same throught th e day when the sun hits on it . It would be a good coloring because you d ont want the dog to get too hot ."
26900,10,1,0,white :: The dog house would not get too hot in the su mmer because white doesn't attract as mutch heat from the sun.
26901,10,2,2,"black :: Black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors. In the experiment it shows that with a black lid on a glass jar, the air temperature will be 53 (DEG)C on average and with a white lid, the air temperature would be 42 (DEG)C on average. This shows that the black lid made the air warmer by 11(DEG)C and therefore black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest."
26904,10,1,1,black ::  so it would keep it warmer in the winter and warm in the soummer so the dog wouldent freeze at night
26905,10,2,2,"white :: A white doghouse would absorb less energy, an d its temperature would be cooler. In the experiment, the jar with the li ght, white lid had a lower temperature than the jar with the darkest, bla ck lid. A dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperatur e, and the dog could use it to stay out of the sun, and cool in summer."
26906,10,1,1,light gray :: that color will not effect the doghouse becau se the light gray will not be to cold or to hot the the doghouse and for the dog who is going to be there in the doghouse
26907,10,1,1,black ::  The doghouse would be hotter because dark col ors (like black) abosorb heat.
26908,10,2,2,"black ::  The color ""Black"" would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because according to the results from the experiment, the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors."
26909,10,2,2,black :: black would be good for a doghouse roof becau se in brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the warmest with black at a n average of 53(DEG) and the onther three colors only in the fortie(DEG) range. so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for t he dog.
26910,10,1,1,white ::  this color might affect the doghouse by keepi ng it cool inside for the dog when it gets to hot in the summer and wants to go somewere where its not so hot
26911,10,2,2,"white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because in the experiment the white lid didn't get as hot a s the black lid. the black lid reached an average of 53(DEG)c, but the w hite lid only reached 42(DEG)c. also with a white piant on the dog house instead of being really hot the dog house will be very cool"
26912,10,0,0,black :: If the dog house was black it would attract m ore light from the sun to the dog house which would keep the dog warmer w hen its outside.
26913,10,2,2,white :: if they use the white paint for the dog house then on the inside of the dog house it wont be as hot as if it were pain ted black or the two shades of gray. the shades of gray and the black pai nt caused the jar to at least get up to 45(DEG)C and at the most the jar got to 53(DEG)C so brandi and jerry would be best of using the white pa int for the dog house because in the experiment the jar only got to 42(DEG) C when they used the white lid.
26915,10,1,1,white ::  white because dogs like to be cool like how they are always panting they do that so the cool down so if it was black then the dog would be way to hot.
26916,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  By painting the doghouse dark gray, it would affect the inside of the house because it would keep it warm while not ov er heating it. However, if placed in an already warm outside temperature, the inside COULD in fact overheat. So a dark gray doghouse would be pref erable in a cooler enviroment."
26918,10,1,1,dark gray :: you want the doghouse to be hot but not too hot so dark grey is right in the middle
26919,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  Dark gray should keep the dog house a medium temprature that isn't too hot, or to cold."
26920,10,1,1,light gray ::  Light gray would keep the doghouse warm so th e dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature so that the dog wont be to hot.
26921,10,1,2,"black :: Black absorbes more heat energy, so the insid e of the dog house will stay warm if it has a light source (the sun). Thi s is proven when they had a black lid on the jar and it gained 53(DEG) w ith the light source being the heat source."
26922,10,1,1,"white ::  The colors affect the temperature of inside t he dog house because darker colors attract more heat than white. I chose white because it has the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)c. The ave rage of black was 53.25(DEG)c, dark gray 48(DEG)c, light gray 45(DEG)c , and white 42(DEG)c. All of this data was from the experiment. The diff erence is 11.25(DEG)c from lowest average to higest average."
26923,10,1,1,"white :: If you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun, and the dog will like it....."
26924,10,1,0,black :: The color will affect how warm or cold the do g house is . Because the white would be 42(DEG) and black would be 53(DEG) .
26925,10,0,0,light gray :: light gray won't affect the dog house in any way.
26926,10,0,0,white :: i choose white because if it gets hot in the summer than the dog can over heat because they only swet on there nose an d paws
26927,10,0,0,light gray :: Light gray holds the same temprature of 48(DEG) every time
26929,10,2,2,"light gray :: Light Gray will keep the inside of the dog house cool, but not to cold, and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog. The data shows tha the light gray jar's average temperature was 45(DEG) C, while the black jar was 53(DEG) C, and the white jar is 42(DEG) C. So the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog."
26931,10,2,2,"white ::  The color white is the color that got the low est air tempature on the Lid color vs Air Tempature inside Glass Jar, so it would keep the doghouse the coolest inside so the dog would be most co mfortable."
26932,10,2,2,"white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse is white. This is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat. The dog wouldn't want a hot sweaty dog house. After 10 minutes of heat from the lamp, the inside air in the black colored jar had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. But the white colored jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. The white colored doghouse is the best color for coolness instead of hot, moisty and sweaty."
26936,10,1,1,"white :: painting the doghouse white will make the dog house absorb less heat, and the inside will stay cooler then if it were p ainted a darker color"
26937,10,2,2,"black :: The color black might affect the doghouse by making it warmer than using a lighter color like white, because black had an average temp of 53 degrees, and the color white had an average temper ature of 42 degress. Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer."
26938,10,2,2,white ::  If the dog house was painted white it would not get as hot on the inside on warm days. The average lowest temperature after 10 minutes a light was 42(DEG) with the white lid.
26939,10,0,0,dark gray :: Darker colors absorb more energy.
26940,10,1,1,dark gray :: The dog house would be warm because dark gray is in the middle of the temperature ranges when exposed to light and hea t.
26941,10,1,1,white :: it'll make the dog house a lot more cooler be cuase the lighter the color the less heat is attracted to it by the sun.
26942,10,1,1,white :: In the summer when its reqqally hot the white color will attract less heat therefore leaving the doghouse cooler.
26943,10,2,2,"white :: I woul'd choose white because, The tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42(DEG)c and the other ones are hotter like Light Gray is 45(DEG)c and Dark Gray is 48(DEG) and, Black at 53(DEG) .So i would have choose the coolest(least hottest) one so the dog would not get hot"
26944,10,1,1,white :: using white as the color for the dog house ro of would be best beacuse the sun light isnt atracted to whight as it is b lack. so the dog will stay cool and not hot inside his house.
26945,10,2,2,"white :: The color white will affect the doghouse in a good way. The color white dosn't absorb as much heat as the other colors do. When they did the experiment the color white only got to 42(DEG) C while the color black got to 53(DEG) C. Also, white turned out to be the color that absorbed the least heat of only 42(DEG) C. Which means insid e the doghouse it will stay nice and cool because it does't absorb as mu ch heat as the other colors do."
26946,10,1,1,light gray ::  Light gray because in the summer it will not ge ttoo hot and in the winter it will not get that cold.
26947,10,0,0,white :: Because the dog house won't get too warm and dogs have fur on them therefore they would not want there doghouse to get to warm.
26948,10,2,1,"white :: White, because the white lid temputature only went up to 42(DEG)C. The other lid colors got a higher temputature, So I chose the one that had the least temputature."
26949,10,1,1,dark gray :: it would make it cooler in the summer and war m in the winter
26950,10,1,1,"black :: it could make it to warm for the dog, it depends on the weather."
26951,10,1,1,"dark gray :: The dark gray would probably be best for the doghouse because it absorbs heat but it still leaves out heat so when it is hot out, the doghouse won't absorb to much heat."
26952,10,1,1,"dark gray :: I think that dark gray would be the best colo r to have on a dog hose because, the dark gray had a steady tepature on i t that wasnt to hot or to cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be cold at night and to hot during the day."
26953,10,2,2,white ::  White would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42(DEG)C.
26954,10,2,2,"white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog hou se will be causeing it to be more comfertable.The white lid was an averag e of 42(DEG)C 3(DEG)C coller than the other lids"
26955,10,1,1,"light gray ::  The color of the doghouse would keep it the right temperature, not to cold and not to warm."
26956,10,1,1,white ::  becuase from there experiment the white lid d idnt get that much heatlike the others
26957,10,1,1,white ::  The color will affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse colder. By painting the doghouse white the air temperature inside the doghouse will stay lower. Since white is a light color it will not absorb a lot of sun like the darker colors will.
26960,10,2,1,dark gray :: it is the second high est and it should keep the dog house worm with out geting to hot
26961,10,0,1,dark gray :: my opinion for light gray cause it seems like an avaerga tempeture out of the four collors so i thing that the dog won t get hot if the collor method works
26963,10,1,1,white ::  the color white will make it cooler in the do g house so the dog wont get hot with all the fur it has.
26965,10,2,2,"white ::  I chose the color white for the doghouse. Thi s is because if the darker the color, the greater increase in temperature , then I would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than the colors light gray, dark gray and black. This would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer. The darker the color, the greater increase in temperat ure is correct because the average temperature of the inside of the jar w ith the black lid was 53(DEG) C when the average temperature of the insi de of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. The white lid jar was 11 (DEG) cooler than the black lid jar."
26966,10,1,1,black :: That color might affect the dog house because it will be really dark. And the tempeture will be really high.
26967,10,2,2,"dark gray ::  I chose this color for the doghouse because s ince the doghouse will be located outside, you dont want the dog to be co ld at night! All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways. The experiment with different colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air te mperature inside the jar. The darker the lid, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat. Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse. So its not too warm for the dog, but if the dog gets ho t, it can always come ourside of the doghouse and sleep."
26968,10,0,1,dark gray :: dark grey because the darker the color the hotter it gets and so if you use light gray its best because white is to cold black is to hot and light grey could be to cold also.
26971,10,0,0,black :: i think it said the blacker the lid is the butter
26974,10,1,1,white :: The doghouse will be cooler and more comftera ble for the dog if it is white.
26976,10,2,2,"white :: White was the lid color with the coolest temp erature after 10 minutes, painting the dog house white will keep the insi de of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the sun's he at than say black paint. In other words the darker the color the more hea t it absorbs and transfers to the inside of the dog house. We want to kee p the dog house as cool as possible so that the dog doesn't over heat."
26977,10,1,1,white ::  The color might effect the doghouse by making it the temperature lower.
26978,10,2,2,"dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it will keep warm i n side but also it will keep cool when needed, so if its hot out side it will be warm but not to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool bu t also warm as well. I know this because with the dark gray average tempe rature was 48 (DEG)c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 (DEG)c and the white average was 42 (DEG)c."
26979,10,2,2,"white ::  The color white would keep the dog house not as hot inside as the other colors, becasue white had the lowest temperature in the experiment. Whit had the lowest temperature average which was 42(DEG)C. Light gray's average was 45(DEG)C. Dark gray's average was 48(DEG)C. Black's average was 53(DEG)C. That shows us that white had the lowest temperature and will keep the dog house not as hot."
26980,10,2,2,"light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house l ight gray. If the dog house is painted in light gray, the temperature ins ide the dog house would not be too hot or too cold. In the result shows t hat the air temperature with light gray lid is 45(DEG)C, with white it's 42(DEG)C, and with dark gray it's 48(DEG)C. Temperature with light gra y is warmer than white lid, but it's not too hot like the dark gray ones."
26981,10,2,1,white ::  This color would be the best to pick to paint the dog house because white reflects the suns energy and dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors...see if you look on the data table it shows that the avarge temerature for each color was black = 53 dark gray =48 light gray =45 white = 42 as shown on the avrages of the differnt color s it shows that white dosnt obersever that much of the suns engergy and t hats why i think white should be what they choose.
26982,10,1,1,black ::  it is warmer than other colors
26983,10,1,1,"white :: white because blakc would absorb alot of the sun thermal energy witch would over heat and dehydrate the dog, same with , dark gray, and light gray, white would be the best choice because white reflects light, as appose to absorbing it, making the inner tempature co oler and more comfordable for the dog."
26987,10,1,1,"light gray :: Light gray will make the inside of the doghou se warm but not too hot, so in the winter a dog won't be cold but in summ er it won't be too hot either. 45(DEG)C is a good warm temperature and t he temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed."
26988,10,1,1,light gray ::  It wont get as much heat as black because dar k colors absorb more heat then other colors.
26989,10,1,1,light gray :: light gray will keep the temperture of the d og house not to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter. if the d og house was white it would have a temerture average of 42(DEG)C and if the dog house was black it would have an average temerture of 53(DEG)C a nd the dark gray would be to warm as well at 48(DEG)C
26990,10,1,2,white :: Painting the dog house White would be very sm art if you didn't want your pet to over heat on those dreadfuly hot summe r days. Based on Brandi and Jerry's experiment the color Black gives off more 11(DEG)C opposed to the color White.
26991,10,1,1,white ::  that color white will effect the heat because the light the color the less heat it will atract and so then the white w ill give off less heat and the dog will stay cool.
26992,10,2,2,"black :: Black paint would warm the inside of the dogh ouse more than the other colors. In the experiment, black heated up an av erage of 53(DEG)C, while the other colors were never increased more than 48(DEG)C. If it was cold outside, that color would warm the doghouse mo re because of the low albedo and high absorbtion of energy."
26994,10,1,1,"dark gray :: the dark gray color would absorbe more heat t han a white or light gray color, keeping the dog warmer, when the tempera ture is colder. But when the temperature is warmer outside it wont absorb e as much heat as the black would, keeping the dog cooler."
26996,10,1,1,white ::  WHite because It will make it a lot more cool temperature wise than if it were black because darker colors absorb a lo t more heat
26997,10,0,0,white :: Will they would like the dog to stay warm in his dog house and white dosent allow that much air to come in
26998,10,1,1,white ::  i would choose white because it attrackes les s heat to the dog house.
26999,10,0,0,black :: it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
27000,10,1,1,black ::  it will make it very hot in the dog house
27001,10,1,2,"dark gray :: I choose dark gray because its not as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white. Its a perfect temperature for the d og in my opinion. It doesnt have to much heat but just right, its a relax ing amount of heat."
27002,10,1,1,white ::  They should paint the dog house white because if they would of painted i tblack it would attract more heat into the ho use and white does not attract heat or the sun light.
27003,10,1,1,"white :: This might affect the inside of the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy from the sun, white would bring a minimum amount of heat."
27004,10,2,2,black :: If you paint the dog house black the dog hous e would be a little bit warmer in the winter the only bad part is that in the summer it will be a little hot inside the dog house. I know this bec ause in the experement that brandi and jerry did it said that the jar wit h the black lid was the hotest.
27007,10,0,0,light gray :: I choose light gray because it would be a nic e temperature. If the dog house was panted black the temperature would av erage 53(DEG) C. If it was dark gray the temperature would average 48(DEG) C. If the dog houyse was painted white then the temperature would average 42(DEG) C. But a light gray color would make the average tempurature a nice comfertable 45(DEG)C.
27009,10,2,2,"dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because this will result in the doghouse being warm but not really hot. It really depends on where t he people live and on the season. Dark gray (48(DEG) C) would be more su itable because it would be pretty hot during summer but not as hot as the black (53(DEG) C), but it also would be warm during the winter, so it's a compromise between the weather. The temperature used for explanation w as the average."
27010,10,2,1,"light gray :: I think that light gray would be the best col or because it absorbs enough light to make the dog warm, without getting it too hot. Black would make it too hot, and white would make it too cold ."
27012,10,2,2,"white ::  having this colour will effect the dog house because light colours reflect heat, so if you paint the house white, then there wont as much heat on the walls, making the doghouse cooler. this i s shown by the fact that in the jar experement, black had the hottest dat a and white had the coolest."
27013,10,1,1,light gray ::  light gray because it will not be to hot or c old
27016,10,2,2,dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it would effect the dog house by not making the inside of it to hot or to cold. The average of the four averages was 47(DEG)c so i chose the closest one to 47(DEG) c and dark gray was 48(DEG)c so thats why i chose dark gray.
27017,10,0,0,black ::  the balck kid brings in the hot air and holds it. good conductor
27018,10,2,1,"white ::  White because in the data it say that white had the lowest tempature with a average of 42(DEG)C. If the they painted it white, it would keep the dog house at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days."
27019,10,1,1,"white :: White because black colors, dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you get light color ""white"" the te mparture would be cooler in there."
27020,10,1,1,white ::  the tempicher will still rise but less then t he other ones
27021,10,1,1,white :: this might affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse cool inside during the summer.
27023,10,2,2,"black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse. One way we know that is, when we did the expiriment with the lid colors, black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius, w hile white ended up with 42 degrees celcius. This proves that black absor bs the most heat. If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse."
27024,10,0,0,white :: white dosn't obsorb light how ever black dose
27025,10,1,1,dark gray :: Dark Gray will affect the doghouse by making it warm in the doghouse. Not to cold like white or light gray and not too hot like the black.
27026,10,1,1,"black ::  The darker the color that more heat it absorbs from the sun, which would make the dog house much warmer. They said, ""becau se darker colors absorb more energy.""."
27027,10,1,1,black :: black might affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will get really hot in the inside cause the sun will produce more heat on the darker color than the lighter colors.
27028,10,1,1,light gray ::  it would make it to where then in the summer it wouldnt be tohot but in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
27029,10,1,1,"white ::  I would say that painting the dog house white would be the best option because white absorbs the leat amount of heat e nergy and since dog-houses are already small they are already hot and you don't want the dog to get overheated, plus dogs have lots of fur to keep them even warmer. If there is a chilly day in the winter, you can put a blanket inside to keep the dog warm, but I would say that altogether, whi te is the best choice."
27030,10,1,1,"light gray :: The color Brandi &amp; Jerry should choose sh ould be light grey because if it was too dark, then the house would get t o hot, but if it was too light, it would be more cooler then the black, b ut it would be very dirty."
27031,10,1,1,"white ::  If they choose white, then the increase in te mperature will be the lowest of all the colors."
27032,10,0,1,"dark gray :: The dark gray color would keep the dog house pretty cool during the summer, but also wouldn't be too cold during the w inter because the temperature was the same the whole time."
27033,10,0,0,black :: black because it atracts sun and makes the do g house have more heat
27034,10,1,1,white ::  If they paint the dog house black or any dark color the dog house would be way to hot for the dog because the dark colors absorbe more heat then light colors.
27035,10,1,1,dark gray ::  Dark gray would probly be the best color because its not black and its not white in the winter it can get really cold and white attracts less heat but in the summer it might be okay but black in the summer might be to much heat so to even things out i think dark gray is okay.
27037,10,0,0,white :: i say white because the dog house is already going to be simi warm inside without the paint. and with the white paint the dog house is already like 40(DEG). so the sun shining on the dog hou se that would put the dog house at 80(DEG) inside during the day. then a t night the dog house will be in the 60s somewhere
27038,10,2,2,"black :: The black paint will make the dog house warme r for the dog because the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat, wit h the highest average temperature (53(DEG)C)."
27039,10,2,2,"black ::  I think black would be the best paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer when the sun is shining down on the doghouse. The average temperature for the color black was 53 degrees while the white color was only 42 degrees. Therefore, black is the better color to paint the doghouse."
27040,10,1,1,light gray ::  if the color was darker but not black it woul d keep the doghouse warmer but not making it to hot beacause like in the experiment it was warm but not hot!!
27041,10,1,1,light gray ::  i chose light gray because the inside of the doghouse would be warm and the dogs fur would keep the dog warm in the wi nter.
27042,10,2,2,white :: the white will affect the tempenture inside t he doghouse by making it cooler. the white absorbs less heat so it keeps more out of the doghouse allowing the dog to be more comfturable.
27043,10,0,0,dark gray :: AHAHA WHY ARE ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS SOO FREA KEN HARD AHAHA
27045,10,2,2,"black ::  the color mght affect the doghouse because brandi and jerry said that""darker colors absorb more energy (heat) "" so a darker colors will make sure the dog is warm ."
27046,10,0,0,black :: The darker color absorbs more energy
27047,10,1,1,dark gray :: Dark Grey! because its not too dark so that t he dog gets to hot in the summer time but its not like it reflects the he at in the winter so the dog and stay warm. The average temp was 48(DEG) C so it was about the middle of the not to hot and not too cold.
27048,10,2,2,"dark gray ::  I would use dark gray. The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer. Black had an average of 53(DEG), whereas whi te had only 42(DEG). However, we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing, and cannot overheat. Dark gray had an average of 48(DEG). Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature. So, i n conclusion, I've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice."
27049,10,2,2,"white :: I chose white because white would keep the do ghouse the coolest temperature. When they did the experiment, the black w as the hottest (53(DEG)c), the dark gray was in the middle (48(DEG)c), the light gray was also in the middle (45(DEG)c) and the white was the c oolest (42(DEG)c)."
27050,10,1,0,light gray :: light gray because its not to light and its n ot to dark
27052,10,1,1,"white :: The color whit will keep the dog house coller , becuase the color whit deflects light better making the dog house cooler."
27053,10,1,1,light gray :: it would not make the doghouse too hot or too cold for the dog.
27054,10,1,1,white :: the lid color white could make a difference b etween the black lid. the tempurture could not be high so they must keep the temputure cool for the dog.
27055,10,1,1,white :: its would make the temperature inside the dog house not as hot so the dog does not overheat
27056,10,1,1,"white ::  the color white might effect the dog house be cause it absorbs less sun light then black ,dark grey or light grey. what this would do is make it so it would not be to hot in the dog house"
27057,10,2,2,"black :: i chose the black color becasue that if the d og likes it hot then this would be the right becasue when they see what c olor would be the hotes and the trials number are 54(DEG), 52(DEG), 53(DEG) ((DEG)c) and the average temp. is 53(DEG)c if the dog likes it hot in there"
27058,10,2,2,"white :: Darker colors usually attract more light. By attracting more light, it usually makes things much warmer. So, if you ha ve the lightest color there is, then it would attract less light and make the doghouse cooler. According to the data, using a black lid made the j ar about 53 degrees, the dark gray made it about 48 degrees, the light gr ay made it 45 degrees, and the white was about 42 degrees. As you can see , the lightest color had the lowest temperature. So, by using the lightes t color, it would attract less heat so they should use the white paint."
27060,10,1,2,"white ::  i would choose white,one reason why is because u wouldnt want your dog to be hot so no dark colors and in your experiment white came the color that didnt get as much heat as others did."
27061,10,1,1,white :: The white color does not absorb as much energ y as black. In the doghouse the temperature will be about 42 (DEG)c when it is a sunny day.
27063,10,1,0,"black ::  If the weather where Brandi and Jerry live is cold, if they painted the doghouse black, it would absorb more heat than dark grey, light grey, and white."
27064,10,1,1,light gray ::  light grey would be good because it wouldnt g et hot in the sun and black would be bad becaus the sun would make it rea lly hot inside the dog house.
27065,10,2,2,"black :: If they paint the doghouse black, their dog w ill always stay warm, because the color black will give the most heat. I know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53(DEG) C and the others were in the low forty's."
27066,10,1,1,white :: this color might make the interior of the hou se cooler.
27067,10,1,1,"white :: This color will be best because when its hot outside, the doghouse will be cooler than if they painted it black or a d arker color."
27068,10,1,1,black :: Black is a dark color so it will absorb more heat and make the dog house a hot temperature.
27069,10,0,0,black :: dfg
27070,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  I think he wshould use the dark gray color to paint his house because, it will be kinda in the middle of the other tem petures. If they paint it white in the winter it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat. If they pick black as the color it would be to hot in the summer because it attracks more heat. Light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white. So I think you should paint it dark gray so that in summer it atracks some heat. And that in the winter it does too. So it would be even out in both summer and winter ."
27073,10,1,1,white ::  Because white reflects off the sun so it woul d keep the dog cooler instead of having a black roof that absorbs light a nd would keep the dog very hot.
27074,10,2,2,"black :: I believe that the dog house should be painte d black because it can keep the dog house warm during the winter. The dat a shows that the inside of the glass jar was 53(DEG)C when the black lid was used. Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in t he glass jar. A disadvantage would be that in the summer the dog house wi ll be too hot, but as for the winter the black is the correct choice."
27075,10,2,2,"white :: The lighter the color the lower the temperatu re. The average temperature of the black lid after just 10 minutes was 53 (DEG), the average temperature for the dark gray lid after 10 minutes wa s 48(DEG), the average temperature for the light gray lid after 10 minut es was 45(DEG), and the average temperature for the white lid after just 10 minutes was 42(DEG). Therefore a light gray and white paint would be best to keep the doghouse cool because it heats up slower then the other colors. But if you were to use black or dark gray, it would keep the dog house warmer."
27076,10,2,2,"white ::  The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then the dog house will get too hot a nd your dog will be hot aswell. As the study shown, the color black had a n average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did. Same as the color black, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color ""Dark gray"" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Also in the study, the color light g ray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degr ees celcious hotter than the color white. The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White b ecause the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made, t he avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if t hey paint their dog house this color, the dog house wouldnt get hot nor y our dog."
27077,10,1,1,white :: This might affect th dog house by making it c ooler in there intead of really hot all the time.
27078,10,2,2,"black ::  Blacks paint color would cause the inside of the doghouse to be warmer than the rest of the colors. This is because bl ack absorbs the most amount oi\f colors over every other color. To prove this in Brandi and Jerry's experiment black kept the temperature of the j ar warmer than all the rest. It was 6(DEG)C warmer than gray, 10(DEG)C warmer than light gray, and 12 (DEG)warmer than white. This clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm."
27079,10,1,0,"dark gray :: During the winter, Brandi and Jerry's dog will stay nice and warm, but not to warm, when summer comes."
27080,10,0,0,"white ::  It could get dirty, you could piant it over agia,and you could draw on the walls."
27082,10,2,1,white :: If brandi and jerry use the color white for t he dog house the dog will not over heat because the color white does not attract the heat as much as the darker colors so the dog house would be m uch cooler.
27083,10,0,0,black ::  cuz black is UGLY just like robert patteson
27084,10,2,2,white :: white will keep the doghouse at a lower tempe rture because in the table it averaged 42(DEG). and black averged 53.25(DEG) so to have a cooler dog house paint it white.
27085,10,2,2,white ::  While using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did. That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.
27086,10,2,2,black :: Black because in the eperiment black was the one that had the highest tempature so the darker the color was the higer the tepature was.
27087,10,1,1,dark gray ::  I would choose dark gray because it doesn't a ttract a ton of light. Which means the dog won't get to hot. But also bec ause it does attract some light which allows it stay warm.
27088,10,1,1,black :: the color black would affect the dog house by keeping it warmest because dark colors absorb light and turn it into heat.
27089,10,1,1,white ::  White is the best color for the doghouse because it absorbs less energy then black paint would. And then the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog.
27090,10,2,2,"white :: Having the doghouse painted white will affect the doghouse by making it absorb less heat causing the doghouse to be co ol inside during the summer. Because in the expirement the black lids ave rage temperature was 53(DEG) and the white lids average temperature was 42(DEG), That`s a 11(DEG) difference. So painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint."
27091,10,1,1,"light gray :: Light gray because it won't be too hot diring the summer, also wont be to cold in the winter."
27093,10,1,1,dark gray :: This will keep the dog warm but it wont get to hot or cold.
27094,10,1,1,dark gray ::  i picked dark gray because it stays the same temperature and in the data table it stayed the same temperature.
27095,10,1,1,white :: because if the dog uses it in the summer it w ill be cooler then a black dog house
27096,10,0,0,white :: its all about all the colors ha thats sick i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace $$$$$$$
27097,10,0,0,black ::  black would be a good color because dark colo rs absorb more energy and it would be more confortable.
27098,10,0,0,dark gray :: I think it would be a good color for the dog house
27099,10,1,1,"white ::  white will effect the dog house.first this wi ll effect it because white will make it cooler in the summer,because whit e doesnt absorb very much heat."
27100,10,2,2,"black :: Black absorbs light. Just like with the jar l id when it was black, it absorbed the most. So if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it."
27101,10,2,2,"black ::  They should paint the doghouse black because black will help keep the dog warm at night and during the winter when it gets cold.When they used the black lid it made it warm at an average of 5 3(DEG)C,copmared to when they used a white lid that only made it warm at an average of 42(DEG)C.Thats a difference of 11(DEG)C."
27103,10,1,1,white :: it will make it be cooler in the dog house
27104,10,2,2,"white :: the color white for the color of the doghouse would keep the doghouse nice and cool, as shown in the table from the sc enario when the glass jar with the white lid had an average temperature o f 42(DEG) compared to the glass jar with the black lid's average tempera ture of 53(DEG)."
27105,10,1,1,"light gray :: light gray cause this will give the dog house some darkness but also bright, so the dog will be able to stay cool and can sleep."
27106,10,1,1,white :: I chose white becauseit was the color that ab sorbed less heat
27107,10,1,1,black ::  if brandi and jerry painted the dog house black then the dog house would be warmer because the darker the color is the energy the dog house can absorb.
27108,10,0,1,dark gray :: It might make the doghouse warmer during wint er months. For example the average heat for the dark grey paint was 48(DEG)C
27109,10,2,2,"black :: Since black is the darkest color of all the o ther colors (Dark gray, light gray, and white), because of the theory tha t darker colors absorbs more energy (heat); the inside of the doghouse wi ll be warmer as of the doghouse being painted the other colors. The proof that black would be the best paint color for the doghouse is because bla ck is the darkest of all the other colors, and darker colors absorbs more energy, also if you look at the data table for the ""Lid color vs. A ir temperature inside glass jar"" experiment, the average temperature for all 4 colors was black being the highest with 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray b eing 48(DEG)C, Light Gray being 45(DEG)C, and White being 42(DEG)C. Th erefore, black would be the best paint color for the doghouse."
27110,10,0,0,white ::  its obsorves less energy from the sun than al l the darker colors
27113,10,0,0,dark gray ::  I think dark grey would be the best one becau se it stays at the same temperture every trial . Also it would be the bes t one because it affect the dog house as much as the others because it st ays at the same constant temperture of 48(DEG)c so that color on the dog house would be realiable.
27114,10,0,0,black :: The black paint color would help make the dog house warmer during winter and insolate it better. In the experiment the black lid had the best insolation because it started at 24(DEG)C and en ded at 53(DEG)C on average. It was by far the best lid.

So if the sun is beating down on the doghouse, it will only reach about 42(DEG) C, instead of 45(DEG) C or higher."
27124,10,1,1,white :: Color will affect the doghouse because if the house is painted black it will get very hot inside but if it is white it will say cool allowing for the dog to be comftrable in side
27125,10,2,2,"white ::  The shade white will make the dog house coole r inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black. I know this because in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, t he air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53(DEG) C, and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C.

27144,10,2,2,"black ::  I chose the paint color black because this co lor would cause the doghouse to be warm all the time. Even on a cloudy or rainy day, Brandi and Jerry's doghouse would be warm inside because the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the s un. After 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the black lid, the air 's average temperature raised 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 5 3(DEG) C. The glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature rai sed only 18(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 42(DEG) C. The differ ence between the two average temperatures for the glass jar with the blac k lid and the glass jar with the white lid was 10(DEG) C. This means tha t the darker the color on an object, the more heat energy the color absor bs, causing the air temperature within the object to be highest compared to any color lighter than it. Therefore, Brandi and Jerry should paint th eir doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the colo r absorbs."
27145,10,1,2,black :: Because the temperature will be high and not low . Painting it black is the highest temperature
27146,10,1,1,white :: I choise white because white would keep the d oghouse cool in the summer.
27147,10,2,2,white ::  the white had the lowest temp. in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm.
27148,10,1,0,white :: white duns not atat so mush heat
27150,10,1,1,white :: white will make the dog house cooler so its m ore comferable in hot weather.
27151,10,0,0,light gray :: IT will affect it because it will absorb less heat
27152,10,1,1,"white :: Barndi and Jerry should choose to paint their doghouse white because it collects less energy from the sun, causing it to be a cooler temperature which is more resonable."
27153,10,1,1,white :: White will not absorb so much heat than the o thers.
27154,10,1,1,light gray :: The color light grey is best for the dog hous e because it does not attract a lot of heat so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze.
27155,10,1,0,"white :: The color white Absorbs the least amount of e nergy, so by coloring the doghouse white it will ensure the dog house is a more comfortable temperature for the dog."
27156,10,1,2,dark gray :: Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use so that the dog doesn't overheat or get too cold. The house would sta y cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Dark gray had an average tem perature of 48(DEG)C while black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C and white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C.
27157,10,2,2,"black ::  if you choose a black color for your dog hous e the tempature would be warmer than if you used a white color, because t he air inside the jar with the black lid was warmer than the lighter colo rs"
27158,10,1,1,light gray :: it will keep the dog cool in the summer and w arm in the winter.
27159,10,2,2,"white ::  The lighter the color, the less air temperature. The white lid color has an average of 42(DEG) C. The black lid color has an average of 53(DEG) C. The white lid color has 11(DEG) C less heat energy than the black lid color. Therefore, If Brandi and Jerry are designing a doghouse for the summer, then they should use the color white since it' ll be cooler... Vise versa, if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather, then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color. The darker the color, the more heat."
27161,10,1,1,white ::  white because white has the least heat drawn to it then all the other colors so your dog would be way cooler and in be tter shape in a white dog house then any others.
27163,10,1,1,white :: the color will keep the doghouse more cold in the summer.
27164,10,2,2,white ::  it wont be as hot as the other paints would l et heat in it shows that white was cooler than the others in there experi ment of lid colors heating up under a lamp
27165,10,1,2,"light gray :: the color of the dohouse should be light gray ,because if the dog house is black its going be very hot inside the dog h ouse in the summer and light gray would be an ok temperature an ave rage of 45(DEG)c for the summer and da winter, and every other seson"
27166,10,1,1,white :: white would make the doghouse less hot on a s unny day making it a place where the dog can cool down.
27167,10,2,2,"white ::  If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse white, than the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black or gray. The average temperature for white was 42(DEG) C, while t he average temperature for black was 53(DEG) C. The difference of the tw o was 11(DEG) C, so this proves that white would be the best color to ch oose."
27168,10,2,2,"white ::  It will keep the doghouse the coolest, avearg e for white was 42(DEG) C, which would keep the dog from overheating."
27169,10,2,2,"white ::  If the color is white it will be more cooler than a black dog house, because black dog houses get hoter and faster, th an white dog house. If it was white it would stay around 40(DEG) instead of 44(DEG) ,48(DEG) ,and 55(DEG)."
27170,10,0,0,"white :: The color of the doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the dog if its black, brown."
27172,10,1,1,white :: it would make it cooler on the inside
27173,10,2,2,white ::  If the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder. In the experiment black paint ma de the air temperature inside the jar have an average of 53(DEG)C and the white paint had an average air temperature inside the jar o f 42(DEG)C.
27175,10,1,1,"black :: I chose black, because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer and lay in the shade or run through water-sprinklers; and in the winter, the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog to sleep comfortably inside (the energy from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghouse)."
27176,10,1,1,dark gray ::  i choose bark gray becase it the best colore for a dog house becase its not to hot and not to cold for the dog and th e average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and if you choosed w hit it be to cold.
27177,10,1,1,black ::  The black lid will attract more heat to the d og house.
27178,10,1,1,white :: because that color stayed the coolest on the jar
27179,10,2,2,"dark gray :: The color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm. The reason I know this is because in the expi rament ""Hot lamp"" the dark gray lid allowed the temperature to rise an average of 48 degrees. which was warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the Li ght gray and white but cooler than the average of the black lid whi ch was 53(DEG)C"
27180,10,1,1,dark gray :: The dark grey will make it so it isnt to hott in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house.
27181,10,2,2,"white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog wil l be. When the lid color was at it's darkest (black) the average temperat ure was 53 degrees celcius. When the lid color was at it's lightest (whit e) the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius. If Brandi and Jerry wa nt to keep their dog cool, they should use white paint."
27182,10,1,1,white :: Cause for each trail and avrage. It is the lo west tepature.
27183,10,1,1,black ::  i chose black because it was the color that kept the jar the hottest degree C(DEG).
27184,10,0,0,white ::  tha color will atract so much heat
27186,10,1,1,light gray :: The color light gray will be the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 45(DEG) C . So from the data you can tell that the color trys to accumilate to the weather. Also it won't be too hot or too cold for the dog to stay in.
27187,10,1,1,light gray ::  The color will make sure the inside doesn't g et too hot or too cold.
27188,10,1,1,white :: If the dog house is white then it will be coo ler in the dog house for the dog.
27189,10,0,0,black :: I will keep the dog warmer at night and durin g winter when its cold.
27190,10,1,1,white ::  It should be white so that on sunny days the dog will have a slightly colder dog house than if it was a darker color.
27192,10,1,1,"black :: It would keep the dog house warm, because darker colors absorb more energy"
27193,10,0,0,dark gray ::  beause he well feel bad and dont like it and he wont sleep.
27194,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  This color is not to cold or to hot, it is ar ound normal temperature. After 10 minutes it should be around the same te mperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days"
27195,10,1,1,black :: the color black will affect the inside of the dog house by the out side where the sun hits will affect the in sid e by makeing it hot.
27196,10,1,1,white :: Keeps the doghouse cool and does not over hea t
27197,10,0,0,"dark gray :: This color can affect the doghouse by keeping an even temperature year round, so the dog house won't get to hot or too cold for the dog. The dark gray lid kept the same temperature the entire test, giving me a conclusion that the dark gray color gives an even temp erature."
27198,10,2,2,"white ::  The paint color that would be best for the doghouse is white.White is the best color to use because it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool during the day, so that way the dog inside of the doghouse doesn't get overheated. I know that white would keep the inside of the doghouse at the lowest temperature because of what the data table shows, which is that the color white's average temperature from being under the lamp for ten minutes was 42(DEG)C which was the lowest average temperature while the color black's average temperature was 53(DEG)C which was the highest temperature (which would cause the doghouse to get exteremely hot during the day, and that would be bad for the dog). So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse."
27199,10,2,2,"dark gray ::  I think that if you choose a color to dark, then it might make the dog really hot, so I would choose dark gray because it won't very hot or very cold. Dark gray has trials that are 48(DEG) C which is hot. However, it is not as hot as the color of black with the highest temperture of 54(DEG) and it's also not as cold as the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41(DEG). So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house."
27200,10,2,2,"white ::  if they were to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture, average tempature was 42(DEG)c for white,unlike the black were tha t is the hottest one there is average tempature was 53(DEG)c. if they wa nt cool for the doghouse then use the white."
27201,10,0,0,black :: Black will affect the dog house becuse black fades when it's in the sun. The color will change lighter.
27202,10,0,0,white :: because the white will not atract that much h eat like the other colors.
27203,10,2,2,"white :: because white does not obsorb as much heat as black, the dog house will be cooler. the white lid reached an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black one."
27204,10,2,1,"white :: In the experiment, the white lid kept the tem perature in the glass the coolest. So if Brandi and Jerry paint the dogho use white, itll keep the inside cool for the dog."
27207,10,2,2,"black ::  The black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house. In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius. For the lowest color, white, it was 42 degrees celcius. This means that the black was 11 celcius warmer than the white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up t he house."
27208,10,2,1,white ::  the white color will keep the dog house cool and not hot. I know this because from the data the white lid was the cold est and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the jar was.
27209,10,1,1,white ::  If the dog house is white it will be colder i n the dog house because if the house is to hot the dog will not want to b e in it
27210,10,2,2,white :: the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot. in the experiment black which was the d arkest had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white (the lightest co lor) had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
27211,10,1,1,white :: the color white would reflect the suns rays a nd keep the dog house cool.
27212,10,1,0,light gray :: Light gray because the dog will probably want to be cool and not hot.
27213,10,1,1,"white :: Assuming that Brandi and Jerry live in a warm climate, a white doghouse would be the better choice. This is because wh ite absorbs less heat, so a white doghouse would stay cooler and keep the dog cooler."
27214,10,1,1,black :: Black would be the best color because black e ntends to absorb heat (Thermal Energy). so the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors wouldnt be as good because anything that is li ght as in the color white it will reflect heat/thermal energy.
27215,10,0,0,dark gray :: I picked Dark grey because it will be consistantly 48(DEG)c i know because in the table For each trial it was 48(DEG)c.
27217,10,2,2,"white :: If you were to build a dog house you wouldn't want it to get to hot, so I would choose white. The average was 42(DEG) C, since it was the coolest of the jars I think it would be best for the dog house."
27219,10,0,0,black :: the color can effect the dog house because if the dog house is a dark color and its hot out side there will be more en ergy.
27221,10,1,1,"white ::  White would be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot, unlike the other colors which got hot really fast."
27222,10,1,1,dark gray ::  the color will effect the dog house because i f it is black it will be hotter because it atracts more heat but if its w hite then it will atracts less heat.
27223,10,2,2,"white ::  The white will keep the dog cooler in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter too. The black the dog would over heat be cause the average is 53(DEG)C, but the white is 42(DEG)C which is ok for the winter and the summer."
27224,10,1,1,black :: make it hoter
27226,10,2,2,"white :: White would be a good color, because on sunny days when the house is being shined on the white will make it cooler rat her then black, dark gray, or light gray. White will be cooler because in the Hot Lamp experiment they tested results for all the 4 colors above. and the average temperatrure for white was 42(DEG) C, light gray was 45(DEG) C, dark gray was 48(DEG) C, and black was 53(DEG)C. That shows that white wa s the coldest color while being shined on by light. Therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse."
27227,10,1,0,light gray ::  light gray because when it is sunny out the d og wont be hot beause black and other dark colors attract the sun.
27228,10,1,1,white ::  white would keep the doghouse colder then any other colors and dogs hate when there hot and really cold so white is pe rfet
27229,10,2,2,"black ::  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house b lack if they want the dog to stay warm, because black absorbed the most h eat at an average of 53.25"
27230,10,0,0,light gray ::  it would keep the dog house at a good temp. the entire year round.
27233,10,2,2,light gray :: Light Gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it a nuetral temperature so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. in the investigation light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would stay nuetral.
27234,10,0,0,white :: Because if you have a dog house and you paint it a white it will be a light grey inside the dog house and so from tha t the dog house will be a nice shade of white with a light coat of grey o n the inside of the doghouse and if the dog house is a square thier will be a perfect color on the d og house.
27235,10,1,0,white :: White. Because the black attracts light so th en the dog house would heat up. th edark Gray is also like the black so t hat wont work either. The last decision was light gray or white so i pick ed white because that color doesnt attract light.
27236,10,1,1,light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should use light gray so it could keep the dog cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
27238,10,2,2,white ::  If the color is a dark color then the tempera ture will increase more than if the color is a lighter shade. White was t he color that affected the temperature the least in the experiment and th at would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature.
27240,10,0,0,dark gray :: it might affect the dog house a little. I cho ose dark gray because it's average.
27242,10,1,1,light gray :: The light gray is the best brcause it will ab sorb the heat from the sun but won't get to hot.
27243,10,0,0,white :: This color will affect the doghouse because the color white will allow more air to be in the doghouse at once.
27244,10,2,2,"white ::  I chose white because from the results of the experiment, white had the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)C which means that the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shining on it all day."
27246,10,1,1,black :: it will make the doghouse really warm inside because the darker the color the more it absorbs energy .
27247,10,1,1,"white :: white color will give back the sunlight, it m ake the doghouse will not get too much hot."
27250,10,1,1,white :: It would reflect the most sunlight so the ins ide temprature would be cooler than if you were to use any of the other c olors
27251,10,1,1,white ::  This color might affect the dog house because the lighter the color the cooler the dog house will be.
27252,10,1,1,"dark gray :: If they choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse, the temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too co ld for the dog. I chose dark gray because black would be too hot for dogs because they have furs but white would be too cold because even though t he dogs have furs, if the temperature is cold, thye will get cold. So i t hink dark gray is the best color to choose."
27253,10,0,0,white ::  White would be the best color because it refl ects the light so it would not be to hot and not to cold in the dog house .
27254,10,2,2,"dark gray :: It will be warm inside the doghouse, but not too warm. The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm. I t hought it might be too hot for the dog."
27257,10,2,2,"dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because black is the darkes t color and from the previous experiment it showed that darker colors abs orb more heat. As for white is would get the least amount of heat. Main r eason I chose dark gray was because from my expericence dogs tend to be c old, so it will be warm but not too hot."
27258,10,2,2,"white :: White would be the best color for a dog house because it would not absorb as much energy as the other colors and there fore a white doghouse would not be as hot inside as black or gray one. Th e results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar with a black lid was 11 degrees C hotter than the jar with a white lid, and the same would apply to a doghouse."
27259,10,1,1,"light gray :: Well, if you paint the dog house light gray i t will keep the dog warm at night ,But not to warm were its over heated."
27260,10,1,1,"black :: becouse black color gets worm fastere then other colors and gets hit black get the tempeture 54 , the other colors get less then that"
27261,10,1,1,white :: If they use the white color than the dog hous e would be cooler because brighter colors reflect the sun and in the end it would bw cooler for the dog which would make the dog happier. also the white color would look good
27262,10,2,2,"black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black. He will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53(DEG)C. In the jar with the white lid, the average tempature was 42(DEG)C. It will be 11(DEG)C warmer in the black doghouse than the white one. That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight."
27263,10,1,2,white :: This color will make the inside of the dog ho use cooler according to the data given by Brandi and Jerry's expirement.
27264,10,2,1,dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their dog house dark gray because dark gray doesn't ge to hot and isn't to cold. In the summer than the dog house will not get to warm yet it will not get to col d in the winter because it does attract some sunlight to keep it at an av erage of 48(DEG)C. That way their dog can always enjoy it's dog house no matter what the temperature is outside.
27265,10,2,1,dark gray ::  the darker the color the warmer it is inside. and if it was black it would be to hot and white or light gray would get to cold.
27266,10,1,1,black :: make the doghouse warmer
27267,10,2,2,"white ::  white would be best because it reflects more energy, the table shows that the average temp. after three trials for the white lid was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the h ighest average(52 degrees celcius) or the black lid."
27268,10,0,0,black :: the darker color obsorbs more heat so it woul d bi a good dog house
27269,10,1,1,"white ::  It would make the dog house cooler because it wouldnt attract as much heat. This is because the darker the color, the more energy it absorbs."
27270,10,2,2,white :: the white paint is the best because it wont get as hot as the other color's will beacuse the highest temp was 43 (DEG)c and the lowest was 41(DEG)c so white is the best becaue it stays the coldest
27271,10,1,1,"black :: It May affect the dog house by making it warm er than the dark grey , light grey and white paint would.because the colo r black attracts heat more than any other color."
27272,10,0,0,light gray :: idk $$$
27273,10,1,1,"black :: the solor energy (sun) will be attracted to the black paint, to make the inside temperature of the doghouse increase."
27274,10,2,2,"white :: if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11(DEG) c cooler then the black, dark grey or light grey"
27276,10,2,2,white :: I think that white would be the best color to paint the dog house because it is the color that reflects the most light so it would keep the dog nice and cool during the summer. This experiment shows that the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar so it is the best color.
27277,10,1,1,dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse because it's not too hot and it's not too cold. The average temperature would be 48(DEG) C. Just right.
27278,10,1,1,white ::  the dog house will be coller in the sun becau se the thermal heat will not get as hot as if it got painted black .
27279,10,1,1,white ::  The color white might affect the dog house be caus lighter colors reflect light.
27280,10,1,2,light gray :: I would say light gray because if it was blac k and in the summer time it would be way to hot and if it was white in th e winter it could get to cold so I think light gray is the best because i t wouldn't be to hot in the summer or to cold in the winter.
27281,10,2,1,black ::  i pick black because black is a dark color an d and darker colors atract energy (like heat).so that way the inside of t he dog house will be worm.like for the black lid all the results were 54 and all the other colors were 10(DEG) and less.
27282,10,1,1,"light gray :: The color will affect it by warming up inside the dog house but not makeing it to hot beacase 48(DEG)c is really hot so why not make it less like 45(DEG)c, and 42(DEG)c and 53(DEG)c is to cold and too hot so make it warm.....wouldn't u want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were?"

27298,10,2,2,"light gray :: The best paint color to paint a dog house bas ed on the results is light gray. I said light gray because it was average 45(DEG)C. it is not too hot and not too cold. If you painted the dog ho use light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm. The black lid was average 53(DEG)C. it got hotter because the color was darker. the d ark gray was average 48(DEG)C. it was warm but not as warm as the black because the color was not as dark. the light gray was average 45(DEG)C. it got cooler because the lid color was lighter.

27300,10,1,1,black :: The color might affect by since it is black i t will absorb more light energy which then makes the temputure higher so the inside will be warmer/hotter.
27301,10,1,1,"white :: The color white will keep the doghouse cool u nder sunlight, because in the expirement, the white color reflects sunlig ht, not absorbing it. so, the doghouse will be cooler"
27302,10,1,0,white :: If it is a lighter color then the doghouse wo n't get as hot as it would if you painted it a darker color.
27303,10,2,2,white :: This color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors. In average 42(DEG) C. Also it will keep the doghouse cool in the summer so the dog doesnt get too warm in the summer.
27304,10,1,1,"light gray ::  They should use light gray paint because the black would attract too much heat. The darker paint would absorb more heat like the black lid. The white paint would be too light, and in the winter wouldn't attract as much heat as needed."
27305,10,2,2,"light gray ::  The color light grey will not absorb too much heat in the Summer to keep the dog cool, but will retain some heat in the winter to keep the dog warm. In the experiment, the color light grey had a temperature that was 21(DEG) higher than the starting temperature of 24(DEG), but did not increase too much like the dark grey and black which rose 24(DEG) and 30(DEG) from the original temperature of 24(DEG)."
27306,10,2,2,white :: White would be the best color because it had the lowest air temperature with 42(DEG)C. This would keep the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days than a darker color would .
27307,10,1,1,light gray ::  For the bog house not to be to cold or hot.
27308,10,2,2,black ::  Black was the highest tempature when under th e lamp so if Brandi and Jerry wanted a warm doghouse they would choose bl ack because black had an avrage of 53(DEG)c insted of other averages lik e 48(DEG)c 45(DEG)c and 42(DEG)c
27309,10,1,1,white ::  i think that if you use a white paint then th e dog house will be nice a cool because if you use black the dog would ge t hot so that why you shuld use white.
27312,10,1,1,"black :: The black paint will trap more heat inside. I t will be hotter in the doghouse than if Brandi and Jerry used dark grey, light grey, or white."
27313,10,2,2,dark gray :: the dark Gray Color Is fine becuz iTs Not to dark and its not too brigth. Dark Gary had A 48(DEG)c avg And The Darkes t is black which HAd a 53(DEG)c avg also the brightest which is wh ite had a 42(DEG)c avg
27315,10,1,1,black :: the black paint color will attract more sun for the dog to keep warm and be comfortable
27316,10,2,2,"white :: White is the best color to paint the doghouse because, based on the experiment, dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't. The hottest air temperature in the jar experiment (53(DEG)c) w as from the jar with the black lid, and the jar with the coolest air temp erature (42(DEG)c) was from the jar with the white lid, proving that lig ht colors don't absorb heat and dark colors do."
27317,10,2,1,"white ::  Painting the doghouse white would ensure that the dog doesn't get too hot while it's inside. White would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than any other color. I know this because in the experiment, the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was less than any other colored lid."
27318,10,1,1,white ::  The color might affect the doghouse by taking in less energy causing the inside of the doghouse to be cooler.
27319,10,2,2,"white ::  By painting the dog house white, it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler. This is proven because in each trial, white had the lowest temperature. For example, in the experiment, White's average tempurate was 42(DEG), compared to black's average, which was 53(DEG); a huge difference!"
27320,10,2,2,white :: i chose white because white reflects the suns energy so it would stay cooler in the doghouse. the data that Brandi and Jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11(DEG)C cooler th an the black lid
27322,10,2,2,light gray ::  I think that light gray will look nice on the outside of the dog house and it will keep the dog very nice and cool because on the data it shows that light gray was the second coolest colored lid.
27323,10,2,1,"white :: The color white will affect the inside of the doghouse because in the Lid vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar table, it shows that the color white doesn't heat up as much as the other colors . The color white reflects the light making it stay cool, which is what y ou want for a doghouse."
27324,10,1,1,black :: i think the color black will make the isnside of the dog house warm because it is a dark color.
27325,10,2,2,"white :: They might use white because it doesnt get ho t as fast as the other colors do. In the data table it shows that the fir st trail was 42(DEG) C the second trial was 43(DEG) C the third was 41(DEG) C and the fourth was 42(DEG) C. For all the other colors the trials got highe r than 43(DEG) C therefore , the white would be best for a dog house bec ause it doesnt get as hot."
27326,10,1,1,light gray :: it will make the dong house in between hot an d cold
27327,10,1,1,white :: white attracts less heat so the dog will no b e harmed on very hot days.
27328,10,1,0,"white :: to design the dogs house i think that the pai nters should you used white paint, because sunlight absorbs into darker c olors because they cannot reflect the light so therefor the dark colors j ust continue to absorb all the light."
27329,10,0,0,black ::  It will make the inside of the dog house cold or warm .
27330,10,2,1,"white :: The color white would be the best to paint th e doghouse because it will be kept cooler than Black, which the average w as 53 degree celcius, dark gray which the average was 48 degree celcius, ligh gray which the average was 45 degrees celcius, and the whites averag e was 42 degree celius. Black absorbs the most heat, while white reflects ."
27332,10,1,1,"light gray ::  Light gray might affect the doghouse by havin g the averge temperature of 45(DEG)c, so if it is cold outside it wont fre eze the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont make the dog too hot. Black had the highest aveage of 53(DEG)c, dark gray had the aveage of 48 (DEG)c,and white had the lowest average of 42(DEG)c. The light gray is just the right temperature for the doghouse of 45(DEG)c."
27333,10,2,2,"light gray :: This color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature. According to the results of the experi ment, the colors were in this order (from the highest to lowest temperatu re): black, dark gray, light gray, white. Dogs do not normally enjoy hot, stuffy enviornments. They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, and get very uncomfortable. This light gray color will allow the dog not to get uncomfortably overheated, but will also not allow him/her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature- as white was resulted in the col dest temperature according to the experiment results."
27334,10,0,0,white :: i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color.
27336,10,2,2,"black :: Black will keep the inside of the doghouse the warmest because it will absorb the most heat. In the lab, black had an average of 53(DEG)C and white had an average of 42(DEG)C."
27337,10,1,1,black :: black is a darker color so there forth it att racts heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
27338,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  Well, the dark gray would make it warmer, but not to warm. &amp;they temperature would stay at one degree. So, its would be 48(DEG) in there."
27340,10,2,2,black :: Black because the black had the highest numbe r the whole expirment and it stayed the warmest out of all of the other c olor
27341,10,2,2,"white :: Coloring the doghouse white will give an effe ct by not making it hot like other colors. In the experiment, they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42(DEG). The black lid was 53(DEG), the dark gray was 48(DEG), and lastly, the light gray was 45(DEG). Therefore, we can conclude that the white attracts the leas t sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less."
27342,10,1,0,light gray :: light gray because when the dog is sleeping i n the dog house and its ranning he will get cold because it is white so t hey for light gray will keep it warm and cool at the same time for those winter days and the cold days with ran
27343,10,1,1,black ::  the sun will be attracted to black and it wil l make the dog house really hot
27344,10,0,1,"white :: darker colors absorb heat from light, so ligh ter colors reflect it."
27345,10,0,0,light gray ::  it will wear.
27346,10,2,2,white :: white because it kept the inside of the jar t he coolest so the dog wouldn't get to hot in the summer. the insidde of t he b jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG) c and the jar with the white lid only had an average of 42(DEG)c
27348,10,2,2,"white :: The color white will ensure that the temperature inside the dog house will stay much cooler than the colors black, dark gray and light gray, because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat energy as darker colors do. For example the inside of the jar with the black colored lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)c while the inside tempeture of a jar with a white lid had an average temperature of only 42(DEG) c. The inside of the jar with the white lid was 11(DEG)c less than the jar did with the black lid."
27350,10,0,0,black :: because it atracks energy and that makes the paint to come off .
27351,10,1,1,light gray :: it wouldnt be to hot to live in(for a dog)but it would be warm and provide heat.
27352,10,1,1,"white :: White, because white paint adsorbse heat less than the darker colors, and you wouldn't want your dog to over heat."
27353,10,1,1,light gray :: light gray will keep the dog house warm in th e winter because it is a dark color and it will also cool down the dog ho use because it is a light color aswel.
27354,10,0,1,white :: it would keep the dog cool enough to withstan d the heat and have enough warmth for winter since dogs have fur on their bodies to keep warm.
27355,10,2,2,"black :: Having a black doghouse might affect the insi de of a doghouse because it would keep it warmer inside because darker co lors such as black absorb heat better. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment t he average temperature for the black lid jar was 53(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C more than the next warmest one, dark gray."
27357,10,2,2,"dark gray :: the darker the color of the doghouse the hott er it will be, so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the w inter you dont want it to be white. so i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer i t wont attract as much as the black would"
27358,10,1,0,:: its depends on were they live if its a hot pl ace then a white dog house but if its a cold place then a black dog house to make the doghouse a little warmer and in the middle if its a mixture.
27359,10,1,1,white :: White would make the dog house cooler and mor e pleastent to live in.
27360,10,2,2,"dark gray :: I would choose dark gray because in the summe r it may become warm for the dog, so black would be too hot. In the winte r black would be the best because it is a color that attracts more energy so it would increase the temperature inside. So for an all around the ye ar comfortable paint I would choose dark gray because its the median betw een them both."

27365,10,2,2,"black :: Black will absorb more heat, therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year. the average temperature inside the ja r with a black lid was 53 degrees Celcius, while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower."
27367,10,1,1,"black :: Because the darker the color the sunlight it attracks because, of the solar energy."
27368,10,2,2,black ::  The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter. The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors. The experiment results show that black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54(DEG)c and the coldest for black was 52(DEG)c. The least warmest was the color white. The highest temperature was 43(DEG)c. the lowest was 41(DEG)c. I chose black because it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter. White would not be as warm as black is.
27369,10,1,1,dark gray :: By painting he dog house the color dark grey might affect the dog house by making it warmer on cold nights but not to hot like the black color will make it. I think this because on the result s chart the black is a higher temp. than the dark grey and the dark grey also always stays a consistent temp. In conclusion I think they sho uld paint the dog house grey because inside it it will niether be to hot nor to cold.
27371,10,2,1,"white ::  White would make a good color for a doghouse because its a rather remains at a rather cool tempertaure not too hot for the poor dogs, as seen on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature for each lid col or table where it shows the average of the white lid's temperture was 42( (DEG) C)"
27372,10,2,2,"white :: The Darker Colors Absorb more energy So if You Picked Black Then The Temperture would increase in the Air , for example in the experiment the Tempeture went to 54(DEG) . And for the white lid it only went up to 41(DEG) thats why painting the dog house white is better choice because it wont get so hot in the dog house."
27373,10,1,1,white ::  it will let it be less hotter.
27374,10,2,2,"white ::  A white colored doghouse will make the air te mperature warmer in warm temperature, but the light color will not mak e the temperature go up a lot. With the black lid color, the temperature of the air i nside the jar was adn average of 53(DEG) after ten minutes. The white ja r was and average of 42(DEG) after ten minutes. Since both jars started at 24(DEG), the temperature of the black jar increased 29(DEG) while th e temperature of the white only increased 18(DEG). The darker the color of something, the more heat the object absorbs. That means that teh white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse, even though that doghouse will wa rm up as well."
27376,10,2,2,"white :: The doghouse would have a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black because the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42(DEG) while the average temperatures of the black , dark gray, and light gray doghouses were 53(DEG), 48(DEG), and 45(DEG) respectively."
27377,10,1,1,black ::  IT WILLBE HOTTER COSE ITS HOT
27378,10,2,2,white :: white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot.
27380,10,1,1,"white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white. This is because in the summer, when the temperature outside gets h otter, the inside of the doghouse will be cooler for the dog. That is bec ause darker colors absorb more light ad heat energy."
27381,10,0,0,dark gray ::  The dark gray color might affect the doghouse by keeping the doghouse the same temperature throughout the year which i s not too cool but not too hot (48(DEG)). I know this because on the dat a table it shows that throughout all the trials the dark gray was the col or that kept the temperature inside the jar stay the same.
27382,10,2,2,"white :: The white paint would be the best choice for a color of a dog house because after 10 minutes of having a white lid, th e air temperature inside the jar was the lowest. It seemed that the light er the color, the lower average temperature the air inside the jar was af ter 10 minutes. This would be the best color for a dog house because if y ou would like to keep your dog cooler in the summertime, having a white p ainted dog house would stay much cooler on the inside that if there was a black paint instead."
27383,10,2,2,"white ::  Painting the doghouse white will raise the temperature only slightly, while painting the doghouse a darker color wil l raise the temperature significantly. In the Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar data table, the temperature inside the jar with the white lid, raised an average of 18(DEG) C from the starting tem perature after 10 minutes. The temperature inside the jar with the black colored lid raised an average of 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature after 10 minutes. If Brandi and Jerry wanted the temperature in the doghouse to be cool, then they would paint the doghouse white. If they wa nted the temperature to be warm, they would paint the doghouse black. I w ould paint the doghouse white."
27384,10,0,0,black :: more dogs like black
27385,10,1,1,"white ::  If they were to use white the dog house would be cooler for the dog to sleep in or just hang out and cause less "" damages"" or issues to the dog"
27386,10,1,1,light gray ::  the light gray so its not to hot and not to c old
27387,10,1,1,"light gray ::  I would choose Dark gray because on a hot day, the dog can stay nice and cool, and on a cold day the color is still a ble to absorb some heat. The experiment proved that darker colors absorb more heat than lighter so the dark gray color would be the best. Also in the trials, The average temp of the jar is 48(DEG)c so the dog would be nice and warm in the house."
27388,10,2,2,white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors. Thats why in Brandi and Jerry's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors.
27390,10,2,2,"white :: the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside. for example, the jar with the white colored lid was cool er; 42(DEG) than the black lid; 53(DEG)"
27391,10,0,0,light gray :: Because it made a mild temperature in the jar
27392,10,1,1,"white :: How this color might affect the doghouse is w hen a color is lighter like the color white, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black. So when it's going to be really hot outs ide, inside the doghouse it will be cool."
27396,10,0,0,white :: the doghouse should be white because it has the warmest or cooldest temperture on the average from the table. it will be warmer or colder than the other colors so the dog living in the doghouse wont be hot or cold.
27397,10,1,1,dark gray :: The color will affect the dighouse by not mak ing it to cold and not making it to warm.
27399,10,1,1,"light gray ::  LIght grey would be a great color to use on a dog house because, the color would not obsorb a lot of heat and and it w ould not be to cold because grey is still a dark color that could obsorb heat, when needed."
27400,10,2,2,"white ::  White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins. under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o, 11 degrees colder than the hottest pai nt color of black the average of the black paint's air was 53."
27401,10,1,1,white ::  the inside wont be as hott.
27402,10,1,2,"dark gray ::  The best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because the temperature inside of the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog, but it wouldn't be too cold. It was 48(DEG)C in the jar with a dark gray lid on average. That is more suitable for a doghouse th an the black lid, which was 53(DEG)C, or the white lid, which was 42(DEG) C."
27403,10,0,0,dark gray :: dark grey because if you use this color the d og house will be about 48 degrees and the dog house will not be to cold
27405,10,0,0,light gray :: Because the dogs liked their home and the dog feels comfortable.
27406,10,0,1,light gray ::  Light gray wouldnt be to hot or to cold so the tem[erature would be just right.
27407,10,2,1,black ::  if you use black paint then it will take in m ore heat because dark colors absorb more energy like they found out in th e lab hot lamp the black was at least 5(DEG)c hotter then all the other colors.
27408,10,1,1,white :: because it obsorb less heat and energy
27409,10,2,2,white ::  It wil make it so the air inside of the dogho use will be cooler so the dog dosnt get to hot. I knowjthis because the d ata shows the averge temperature for white was 42(DEG)c.
27410,10,1,1,white ::  Less heat in the dog house so there would be much more comfort for the dog.

27414,10,1,1,dark gray :: It will take in heat in the winter and won't take as much in in the summer as black would.
27415,10,1,1,white :: white absorbs less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
27416,10,2,2,light gray ::  Light gray is the best color for the dog hous e because it doesn't make the dog house too hot but it also doesn't make the dog house too cold. The black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C which is too hot for a dog in the summer. it needs to be at a rela xing temperature which is 45(DEG)C for the light gray. If i were to choo se the white it would be too cold for the poor dog to be in. The light gr ay color would make it so that the dog could be very confortable in his l ittle house.

27420,10,0,0,white :: porque es el que da mas inside de glass
27421,10,2,2,black :: If the color of the doghouse was black then i t would make the inside of the doghouse warmer inside. In the experiment it was 53(DEG)C on average in the jar when the lid was black and only 42 (DEG)C on average when the lid of the jar was white.
27422,10,1,1,black :: i think they should use blak beacause it woul d be warmer for the dog.
27423,10,0,0,white :: The darker colors will absorb heat faster tha n lighter colors.
27424,10,0,0,"black :: Black, because on a warm day the dog house would heat up but it wouldnt be too hot for the dog. And on a cold day the dog house should be the same tempature ( 53(DEG) C ) or get a little col der, but not to cold for the animal."
27425,10,2,2,"dark gray :: I chose the dark gray paint color because it would keep the dog warmer in the winter than the white or light gray pain t, but cooler in the summer than the black paint would. The experiment su pports this because the dark grey paint in the experiment made the inside temperature an average of 48(DEG)C, while the highest average data, the black paint, was a temperature of 53(DEG)C, too hot, and the lowest av erage data, the white paint, was 42(DEG)C, too cold for the dog."
27426,10,0,1,white ::  white would not attract as much heat as the o ther darker colors
27427,10,2,2,"light gray ::  Light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse. Light gray had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't b e too cold or too warm for a dog. A white doghouse was 42 degrees which m ight make the dog cold and black and dark gray would make the dog too war m. Dark grays average was 48 and blacks average was 53, much too warm.The refore light gray would be the best color."
27428,10,0,0,white ::  If the insid eof the dog house is white then the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
27429,10,0,1,black :: If you see the doghouse black then you can se e better because the color is black you can see black better in the after noon.
27430,10,2,2,white :: I would pick white paint to paint the dog hou se because according to the experiment white was the color that the insid e of the jar would be less hot. Accordig to Brandi and Jerry's data the w hite lid had a temperature 42(DEG)C inside the jar and the black lid was 53(DEG)C and i dont want my dog to be to hot or sufficate in the dog ho use.
27431,10,1,1,"light gray :: I would chose light gray because in the summe r, a black house might over-heat the dog, however in the winter a white h ouse might be too cool. A light gray house would repel heat in the summer , and allow more heat in the winter."
27432,10,1,2,"dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry colored the doghouse white, it would not asorb the heatness like the color black. Therefore, it would feel more comfortable for the dog when it is hot outside. The reason why black was to asorb heat, because in the data table it had higher degree then white, which had a lowest degree in temperature."
27433,10,1,1,light gray :: the color would keep the doghouse at a perfec t temperature not to hot or not to cold
27434,10,1,1,black :: Black would be a good color for the dog house because in the day it would get hotter because black absorbs heat causin g it to be warmer in their at night.
27436,10,2,2,"white :: Assuming that the location of the doghouse ha s a warm climate, the white paint color will be more likely to keep the t emperature of the air inside the doghouse at a cooler, or lower, temperat ure. This can be said because the white paint color, on average, made the air inside the glass jar a temperature of 42(DEG) C, compared to 53(DEG) C for black paint, 48(DEG) C for dark gray paint, and 45(DEG) C for light gr ay paint. It is vital that the doghouse maintains a low temperature so th at the dog, that stays inside the doghouse, doesn't overheat."
27437,10,2,2,white ::  They should use white paint because when the sun comes out the doghouse won't get as much heat absorbed. As shown in t he table the darker lid they used the hotter the air became and white is the lightest color used and it had the lowest temperature.
27438,10,2,2,dark gray ::  The color will effect the dog house by keepin g it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in t he winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar t he same temperature for all 3 trials; which the average temperature was 48(DEG)C.
27439,10,2,2,"dark gray :: I think the best color for the dog house is D rrk gray, because it's not the hotest color or the coldest which will hel p the dog stay cool but also warm. It showed that in each trial the tempe rture was 48(DEG)C for the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time. Also Dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6(DEG)C average."
27442,10,2,2,"black ::  Black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house because of the insulation if provides within. Out of all the colors of white, dark gray, light gray, black and white, black had the highest temperature within the glass jar with and average of 53(DEG)C while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with an average of 42(DEG) C. Thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a high temperature than any other. However, you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed. If the doghouse should be placed outdo ors, black would be the ideal color to keep the dog warm during cold wint ers. If placed indoors, the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm."
27443,10,2,1,"white :: White would be the best color because it will be more cooler in the dog house then any of the colors above. In t he data table with black paint, the average was 53 ((DEG)C). The w hite paint, the average was 42 ((DEG)C). So that shows that if you go fo r light colors it will reduce the heat inside but if you do want it reall y hot then go for the dark colors."
27444,10,0,0,black :: 1:The dog will be feeling like fanetting. 2:The dog will gett thirsty. 3:The dog will breath reeally hard.
27446,10,0,0,dark gray :: because dark gray color absorb more energy.
27447,10,2,2,white :: This color effects the dog house because it m akes it cooler according to the Hot lamp experiment.In there experiment t he white lid was the coolest.
27449,10,0,0,white ::  how white would affect the doghouse is that i t would get drityer more easly thats how it would affect the doghouse.
27450,10,2,2,light gray ::  In there experiment they found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use a light grey for the dog house because it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stay nice and cool inside but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right tempature.
27451,10,1,1,dark gray :: black because it will get to hot
27453,10,1,1,"white :: the lighter the color, the less heat will be inside the dog house. the darker the color, more heat will be inside the dog house"
27455,10,0,1,"dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because, where I live, it can get fairly cold. The dark gray might offer the dog warmth during the winter and at night, without over heating the doghouse. And hopefully in the summer the dog will be able to run around and wont have to worry about getting to hot in the doghouse then. I think your question is too vague. It really depends on the climate and dog breed."
27456,10,1,1,white :: I would choose white because i would want my dog to not have all that heat trapped up in a little tiny space. That hot air which is absorbed through dark colors i wouldn't want my dog sitting in that. I would want him to be cool so thats why i choose the white col or as a paint for a doghouse.
27457,10,2,2,"white :: Based on the data, white had the lowest tempe rature average of 42, while others have an average of 45, 48, and 53. It all depends on the dog you are getting, if its fur is dark, better to ge t light colors so it can be cooler."
27458,10,1,1,black :: this color would keep the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract heat from the son.
27459,10,1,1,white :: The color white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color and the doghouse wont get as hot.
27461,10,2,1,"white ::  White has less heat absorbtion. If the sun is out and it is hot, the dog house will still be cool inside.White has a t emperature in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for 10 minutes. light gray has temperatures in the mid 40's. Dark gray is high 40's. ANd black is low to mid 50's."
27463,10,1,1,dark gray :: The temperature will stay the same in the col d and hot weather. The temperature will never be too hot or too cold.
27465,10,2,2,white :: The white lid had the lowest temperature and the black lid had the highest temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house wont get hot because the white paint will deflect the heat.
27466,10,2,2,"white :: White, because the data showed the tempatures of each of the lids, and from the data table it shows that black (53degr ees) was the highest, and white(42degrees) was the lowest. So if they wan t a to paint the dog house, they should paint it white, do to , the tempa ture of the dog house wont be to hot for the dog to be in."
27468,10,0,0,"white :: I choose white because if the doghouse is out side, then the white would absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm with out overheating it."
27469,10,2,2,black :: the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy. black is the warmest in the investigation for the lamp and colo r of the lid it got an average of 53(DEG) C. the lightest color (white) got an average of 42(DEG) C.
27470,10,1,1,dark gray :: A dark gray color would absorb more heat then light gray and white making it warmer but not as much as black so it won t get too warm.
27471,10,2,1,"black :: Black would keep the doghouse warmer during cold winters because it holds more heat than the White or the Grays. The average for the Black was 53(DEG)c, and the white was 42(DEG)c. That means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat."
27472,10,1,1,white :: With white the temperaturein the dog house wo uld stay nice andd cool in the summer
27473,10,2,2,"white :: the color white would affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than any other of the colors. i know this because in th e experiment, the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid had a change of temperature of 29."
27474,10,1,2,white :: The doghouse will usually be cool inside even on sunny days because the light from the sun will reflect off of the dog house causing the light to not enter it and make the transformation into thermal ( heat ) energy.
27475,10,2,2,white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler because in the data of the experiment the average temperature of white is 42(DEG)c and blacks average is 53(DEG)c
27476,10,2,2,"white ::  that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time. i know this because in the experiment the black lid had an average of 53 and white had an average of 42, so thats more than a 10(DEG)c difference."
27477,10,1,1,light gray :: Light Gray because its not hot or cold but a little warmer than white.
27478,10,1,1,black :: it will keep the dog house warmer because the black attracks heat
27479,10,1,1,black ::  The color black because it would be warm in t he doghouse. Since black absorbs more heat black would be best to keep th e dog warm rather than cold.
27480,10,1,2,"white ::  i think the dog house should be white, becaus e in the experiment, white didnt get very hot. the highest temperature wa s 43(DEG)C and the lowest was 41(DEG)C."
27481,10,2,2,"dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry used the color dark gray for their doghouse that would be the best color because it would keep the doghouse warm and cool depending on the seasons. The color dark gray in the jar experiment had an average of 48(DEG)C. That makes the temp erature of the doghouse in general, not to hot and not to cool based on t he jar experiment."
27482,10,2,2,"white :: white will make the doghouse cooler than a da rker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the aver age temperature inside the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C and inside the black lid it was 53(DEG)C, that is 11(DEG)C warmer."
27483,10,2,2,black :: If he choses black the doghouse will get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
27484,10,2,2,"white :: It would make it cooler in there for the dog, because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then dark er colors. For example, the average for the black lid was 53(DEG)C, but the average for the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Which is a lot less. So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white."
27485,10,2,2,white :: A white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside. I know this because in the experiment the bl ack lid got to be the hottest at 54(DEG)C well white was the coolest at 42(DEG)C. White was also cooler then dark gray at 48(DEG)C and light gr ay at 44(DEG)C. So white would be the coolest for the doghouse.
27486,10,1,1,black ::  The dog house if painted black will be warmer because the color black atracts heat.
27488,10,1,1,light gray :: it can make it hot but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as black or dark gray
27489,10,1,1,black ::  the darker the color the more heat it absorbs . Haveing a black dog house would make it warm on the inside
27492,10,0,0,black :: is to dark
27493,10,1,1,"white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because according to this expiriment whit absorbs the most heat with an average temperature of 42(DEG)C compared to the black paint which had an average tempurature of 53.25(DEG)C, making the dog house a cooler place to live."
27494,10,1,1,"black :: if the doghouse is black than the inside will be warmer when there is sun shining on it, so the dog will stay warm"
27496,10,1,0,"white :: the color white reflects most of the sun's he at, while the color black absorbs most of the sun's heat."
27499,10,1,1,black ::  the darker the color the greater the increase in the air temperature in the dog house because darker colors absorb mor e energy.
27500,10,1,1,white :: white will ceep the doghouse cooler
27501,10,0,0,black :: black will affect the dog house buy keeping h eat in
27503,10,1,1,"white :: White doesn't attract heat but black, dark gray and light gray do, so the dog would be kept cool."
27505,10,0,0,dark gray ::  dark gray will keep the dog house the same te mp in the summer and winter as long as therer is light.
27506,10,1,1,white ::  white is the best becouse it is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
27508,10,1,1,light gray :: If the doghouse is light gray then in the win ter it will be slightly warmer than the actual temperature and in the sum mer it will be slightly cooler than the actual temperature.
27509,10,1,1,"light gray :: based off the results, you would want this co lor because it doesn't attract to much heat , and it wouldn't be to cold at the same time."
27510,10,1,1,light gray :: I think light gray would be the best because it wouldn't be too hot or cold
27511,10,2,2,"white :: the white dog house will not make the dog as hot inside because white is a very bright color, but black is a dark colo r so it will get hotter. In the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on."
27512,10,2,2,"light gray :: I choose light gray because light gray isnt t oo light and is not too dark. Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature. If it was white, it would be too cold and if it was black, then it would be too hot. In the experiment, light gray ha d an average temperature of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and black had 53(DEG)C."
27513,10,1,2,white :: Brandi and Jerry should use white paint for t here dog house because in the investagation the white paint color only ha d a 18(DEG) increase as black paint had a 29(DEG) increase. the diffren ce between the two paint's tempurture was 11(DEG).
27515,10,1,1,black ::  The color black would make the house warmer o n the inside.
27518,10,2,2,"light gray ::  This color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enou gh to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days. On average, the heat inside the jar with a light gray (45(DEG)C) was cooler than tha t of Black (53(DEG)C) and dark gray (48(DEG)C)"
27519,10,1,1,white :: so if it is hot out side and the dog wants to go in side the dog house then it will be cooler because the color of the dog house is white.
27520,10,1,1,light gray ::  It depends on the dog. If the dog has medium amount of hair then the best color would probably be light gray because i t doesnt obsorb that much heat energy. But if the dog was a hairless one then it would be best to go with black so that way the dog could get enou gh heat in the doghouse.
27521,10,1,1,dark gray :: dark grey will make the dog house warm inside but it wont get to hot for the dog. in the jar the air tempature insde t he jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48. there for in the dog house it wont be to cold or to hot it will be warm
27523,10,2,1,"black :: the color black is going to make the doghouse more warm, because darker colors absorb more energy."
27525,10,0,0,white :: it will keep the temp. in the 40(DEG) area ( C(DEG)) and not burn up the dog inside the dog-house.
27526,10,2,2,white ::  The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause the dog won't get too hot in the summer because the weather is warme r in the summer and white is the coolest color out of the four. White was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees.
27527,10,2,2,light gray :: Choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color. It wouldn't be to hot or to cold for the dog. During the experiment the black lid produced a very hot temerature o f 53(DEG)C. The white lid created a temperature of 42(DEG)C. Choosing the light gray color would be a good medium.
27528,10,2,2,"white :: White might affect the inside of the dog hous e because, it went up only 20 degrees from the starting temperature. I th ink white is the best paint color to use because, it had the lowest tempe ratures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy."
27529,10,2,2,"white ::  white would make the dog house less hot. the data table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1,2, and 3."
27530,10,0,0,white :: becuse dog can ony see black and white so that will affect the dog house
27531,10,2,2,"white ::  The color white wouldn't absorb as much ener gy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm. With a black lid, the jar was an average temperture was 53(DEG) C after 10 minu tes. With the White lid the temperature was an average of 42(DEG) C. Thi s shows that the lighter the color, the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house. Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog, and therefore making white the right color."
27532,10,0,0,light gray :: light gray how it might affect the doghouse i s that the lighting could be so powerful from the light that the color mi ght get really hot well the dog house might get really hot.
27533,10,2,1,light gray :: I think Light gray will be the best for the d og because in the summer it will not too warm (hot) and winter not too co ld. Since the data prove that the darker the object the more it will abso rb the energy which gain or lose heat based the color. And since the aver age data of Light gray is about in the middle which was 45(DEG)C.
27534,10,2,2,"white :: A white color would keep it cooler because, a ccording to the data, white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degr ees celcius, while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degree s celcius."
27535,10,1,1,light gray ::  Based on the data I think light grey would be the best color. I think that because it would make the doghouse warm fo r the winter but it wont be too hot in the summer.
27536,10,1,1,light gray :: A light gray would make the dog house warm bu t not too cold like when it is raining you don't want to have a white dog house. The average for the black colored lid was 53(DEG)C which is too hot and the dark gray was 48(DEG)C which is still a little too hot and t he average for the light gray is 45(DEG)C and the white was 42(DEG)C so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends o n the dog so if you had a shaved or close to shaved dog you would maybe e ven want a dark gray dog house but if you had a dog with a lot of hair yo u would want a white dog house.
27537,10,1,1,"white :: The white color would absorb the least amount of heat in the doghouse, meaning it would be great for summer. But if yo u want the warmer house in the winter, the black doghouse should do the t rick."
27538,10,0,0,black ::  Really black.
27539,10,2,1,"white ::  If you use white paint color to paint a dog h ouse, it would be the best choice to keep the dog cool during a hot day. In the experiment out of the 4 tested lid colors, white held out to be th e one with the lowest temperature."
27540,10,1,1,white ::  This color might affect the doghouse because since white doesn't absorb any heat the dog house inside will be cool eno ugh for the dog to be in. Darker color absorbs more energy and since whit e is the lightest color of all the colors there will be no energy absorbe d.
27541,10,0,1,white :: This will help the dog so it wont get hot in the summer.
27542,10,1,2,"dark gray :: The color might affect the dog house by giving the doghouse more heat in the inside, but also not giving to much heat inside the doghouse. Dark gray will attract at an average about 48(DEG) C of heat, the black color has to much heat about 53(DEG) C, and the color white has to little of heat at about 42(DEG) C. So therefore the dark gray would be best for the color of the doghouse."
27544,10,2,2,white ::  The color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog. As shown in the data white is the coolest. The average for a black lid is 53(DEG) C. The dark gray lid is 48(DEG) C the light gray lid is 45(DEG) C and the white lid is 42(DEG) C. Therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog.
27545,10,1,1,white :: With a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is.
27546,10,1,1,"black ::  The color black whould be the best color to paint the dog house because, you will have a higher temperature with a darker color it will have a warmer. There will be a higher chance for the doghouse to be at a higher temperature."
27547,10,1,1,black ::  it will keep it hot because black absorbes the suns rays faster then a lighter coller
27549,10,1,1,"light gray ::  this color will affect the doghouse by heatin it, but not overheating the doghouse."
27551,10,2,2,dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color because it wo uldn't be too cold nor to hot. in the experiment the dark gray jar was in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the wa rmest like black but somewhat in the middle with an average temp of 48(DEG) c
27552,10,1,1,white :: The dog house would stay cooler because white doesn't attract the that much heat.
27553,10,2,2,white :: The color white had the lowist temp at the en d of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
27554,10,1,1,dark gray :: It wold make it cooler in the sumer but warme r in the winter because the dark coler would atraket the heat.
27555,10,2,2,"white ::  White would be better for the doghouse becaus e it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did. white o nly absorbed an average of 42(DEG) c, where black absorbed an average of 53(DEG) c."
27556,10,2,2,"dark gray :: Dark Gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold. Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray wouldn't be too hot or cold. In an Air temperatur e expirement, four colors were measured; Black, Dark Gray, Light Gray, an d White. The Data measured Black as 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray as 48(DEG)C, Li ght Gray 45(DEG), and White 42(DEG)C. Dark Gray as you see isn't too wa rm, neither too cold, making it the best color for the doghouse."
27557,10,2,2,"white ::  Using white paint would make the doghouse col der than if they used black paint. As was shown by the table, the average temperature of the jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, while the average temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C. The jar with the black lid was 11(DEG)C warmer than the jar with the white lid. Thus, usi ng white paint would also make the doghouse colder than using black paint , and Brandi and Jerry should use white paint."
27558,10,1,1,white :: white will make the dog house cooler because it reflects the most light
27559,10,2,2,white ::  The black was 9(DEG) C warmer then the white colored paint. The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog. The white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
27560,10,2,2,white :: painting the dog house white will keep the inside cooler then the black paint job by 11(DEG)C. the average temperature for the black lid jar air was 53(DEG)C where as the average temperature for the white lid jar air was an average of 42(DEG)C.
27561,10,2,1,"white :: White you be the best color for Brandi and Je rry's dog house because acording to their experiment, white absorbs less energy than darker colors. Therefor Brandi and Jerry's dog would be able to stay cool in warm weather."
27562,10,0,1,dark gray :: It won't be too hot or too cold in the dog ho use.
27563,10,0,0,white ::  bright colers reflect the light so the dog wi ll not get so hot.
27565,10,1,1,light gray :: the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it wou ld be cold for him in the winter. so keeping it at a light darker color y ou ahve a mixeture of the 2.
27567,10,1,1,white :: i think it would be white because then when i t is hot out side then it would wouldnt be as hot in the dog house then i t would be when the dog house is white.
27568,10,2,2,light gray ::  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45(DEG)Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3(DEG)Celsius making an 8(DEG)Celsius difference between the two.
27569,10,2,2,"black ::  The color black will be more warmer inside than any other colors above thus, Brandi and Jerry should paint th dog ho use black. According to the results from the experiment, the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53. The darker the color the warmer the air temperature was in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy."
27570,10,2,2,"black :: The black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat, making the dog house warmer. I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results, the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar."
27571,10,0,0,white ::  because white dose not atract anything
27572,10,1,1,white :: white would be better because during the summ er it would be cool with a white dog house and it would be hot and humid with a black dog house
27573,10,1,1,dark gray :: it will warm the dog house but not get it to warm
27574,10,2,1,light gray :: Light gray would be a little cool in tempatur e as the black or dark gray one would get to hot and the white one would get a little cold.
27576,10,2,2,"white :: The white paint color would be cooler becaus e on a sunny hot day the dog might be really hot, so the dog would just g o in his dog house. The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat. Ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun. The experiment tells it all, the white after only 10 minutes got up to 40(DEG)c as the other colors went up to 45, 48, and 53. The dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest. Coming to a solution the white p aint would be the best to use for a dog house."
27577,10,2,2,black :: White would keep the doghouse the coldest (ar ound 40). If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties. If th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties. If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties. If the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties. White would reflect the light and not heat up t he doghouse as much as any other color.
27578,10,0,0,white :: it does not atract as much lite as a darker c olor
27579,10,1,1,black :: because black absorbs heat more then the othe r colors
27580,10,1,1,white :: The color white absorbs less heat therefore w ill reduce the impact the sun has on the temperature inside the doghouse.
27581,10,1,1,"black :: The color black prevents more cold and absorb s more thermal energy, making it a warmer place for the dog."
27582,10,1,0,light gray ::  Light gray might affect the inside of the dog house because dark colors attract the sun and you do not want the dog to be too hot. But then you dont want white so the dog is not too cold. So t he average temperature for light gray is a good temperature for an living environment.
27583,10,2,2,"light gray ::  Painting the doghouse light gray would keep t he doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter. I know this beca use the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar, the c ooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar"
27584,10,1,1,white :: white becuase if you live in a hot place the dog house will be less hot because white reflect most of the light off of the dog house.
27585,10,1,1,light gray :: This color will affect the doghouse for the b est. The darker color keeps in heat but sometimes heat isn't always good. I found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air t emperature but won't be to hot for the dog.
27586,10,1,1,"light gray :: i think light gray would work the best becaus e,if its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside,and in the winter it will manage to stay warm inside."
27587,10,1,0,"dark gray ::  if they painted the doghouse dark gray, then the doghouse would stay warm because in trials #1-3 the temperatures stay ed at 48(DEG)C."
