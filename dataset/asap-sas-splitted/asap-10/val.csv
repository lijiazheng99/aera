25949,10,2,2,black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog. iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest.
25950,10,1,1,white :: White because you wouldn't want the dog to ge t to hot.
25962,10,1,1,white :: it will give the dog more cool air because li ghter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
25965,10,0,1,"dark gray ::  All choosable colors are waht you might call a 'double edged sword' because, altough the dark colors will keep the dog warm in winter, it'll make him to hot in summer. And while the light col ors will keep him cool in summer, they wont do much for him in winter."
25970,10,0,0,light gray :: on cold days the light gray absorbs the hotte r temp. and on hot days it douse not absorb as much.
25971,10,2,2,"white ::  The best color to paint the dog house would b e white. White reflects more light than black. This would keep the inside temperature of the dog house cooler than it would if the dog house were painted black. In the experiment, the white lid was at an average of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefore, the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house."
25975,10,1,2,"white ::  The color might affect the dog house just a l ittle bit, because the white color had the lowest temp. compared to the b lack wich its average was 53. Thats a(n) 11 (DEG)c diferanc an the dark grey was a(n) 6(DEG)c differance. also the light gray was a(n) 3(DEG)c differance."
25980,10,1,0,black :: Black is my choice because if it kept the jar warm for ten minutes then black would be able to keep a doghouse warm for longer.
25983,10,0,0,black :: because it's so string
25989,10,2,2,"black ::  Black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53(DEG)C, which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors. So to me I think black would be the best color."
26005,10,1,1,white ::  the white colored paint might make the inside o the dog house colder than out side on a hot day s ohe or she dont get way to hot.
26006,10,1,1,light gray :: It would be a good color because it wouldnt b e too cold or too hot for the dog. it would be just right.
26007,10,2,1,"white ::  On a hot summer day, it's easy for dogs to ge t overheated, harming them and even killing them. Therefore, white is the best color of paint to use because the air inside of it only increases b y 18(DEG)C after ten minutes of exposure to light and heat. With black p aint, it increases by 29(DEG)C, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health."
26009,10,1,0,white ::  I think the dog house should be white because it would keep the dog cool in the hot summer sun.
26016,10,1,1,white :: i chose white so it would be cool in the summ er
26017,10,2,2,white :: the best color to choose would be white becau se on average white had the lowest temperature of all the colors meeaning the inside of the doghouse would be cooler
26020,10,1,1,white :: It well allow it to be coler then bieng hot.
26028,10,1,1,dark gray ::  dark grey because in the summer it wont be to hot and in the winter it wont be to cold.
26030,10,1,1,black :: Black will affect the doghouse by makeing it hotter.
26032,10,1,1,"white :: The color of the dog house being white wil ca use the doghouse to stay cooler under sunlight. This is beacuse the color white reflects the light away from the doghouse, and the light will not be absorbed and turned into heat energy inside the doghouse."
26036,10,1,1,white :: The best color to choos for a dog house is wh it because it will keep the dog cooler and it will not get dehidrated. Th e dog will stay cooler inside the white doghouse.
26038,10,2,2,"black :: the best paint color for the house would be b lack because it would keep the dog warmer than other colors would. the bl ack lid was 53(DEG), and all others were between 42 and 48(DEG)"
26043,10,0,0,dark gray :: i dont think it will efect it because it has the same number for each trial
26052,10,1,2,black :: Dark colors like black and dark gray absorb m ore energy and make it hotter than if I used white or light gray.
26053,10,2,2,white :: it would keep the doghouse cooler because the white lid kept the jar the cooler than the other lids did
26057,10,2,2,"white :: How the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat, so the dog wont be as hot. If Brandi an d Jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its ((DEG)C) was 54, in trial two its ((DEG) C) were 52, in trial 3 its ((DEG)C) were 54 and the average is 53. So these re sults show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not mak e the dog comfortable with all the heat. While the white lid in the exper iment had very low temperatures its ((DEG)C) were 42,43,41 and its avera ge came to 42 ((DEG)C) so this shows that the white will absorb barley a ny heat."
26064,10,2,2,"white ::  The color White might affect the inside of th e doghouse by keeping it the coolest. The average for the color black was 53(DEG)C, the average for Dark Grey was 48(DEG)C, the average for Ligh t Grey was 45(DEG)C, and the average for White was 42(DEG)C. This shows that White is the coolest color and should be used for the doghouse to k eep the doghouse cool."
26067,10,2,2,"black ::  the color black heats the doghouse the most. it gets to 53 degrees celcius in there where as dark grey=48 degrees, lig ht grey=45 degrees, and white=42 degrees. so black would be the best colo r"
26068,10,1,1,dark gray :: the dark gray will obsorb some heat and keep the dog house warm
26073,10,2,2,"black :: The doghouse should be painted black because then the dog will stay warm during the winter if he/she has to stay outsi de. When the black lid was used in the expiriment, it was on averag e 5 degrees warmer inside the jar than with the dark gray lid, 8 degrees warmer than the light gray lid, and 11 degrees warmer than the white. The refore, if the doghouse is painted black, the dog will keep warm much bet ter than if the doghouse was painted dark gray, light gray, or white."
26075,10,1,2,"light gray :: The darker the color, the warmer the doghouse would be (black warmest 54(DEG)C). The dog might overheat if the doghouse is too hot. the lighter the color, the colder the doghouse (white lowest 41(DEG)C). They wouldnt want the doghouse to be uncomfortibly cold. so dark grey or light grey would be best (avg. 46.5(DEG)C)."
26092,10,1,1,black ::  i chose black so the inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53(DEG)C and wont get cold over the time the dog is outside
26101,10,2,2,"white :: By painting the doghouse white, the inside of the doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment. The data shows that when the lid was black, the air temperature was warmest, and when the lid was white, the air temperature was coolest. Therefore, painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature f or the dog."
26103,10,1,1,black :: black will mack it hot in the dog house because the lap is hiting black and black atrackes heat
26105,10,2,2,"white :: White. It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18(DEG) C. In the experiment, the starting temperature of was 24(DEG) C and after ten minutes under a lamp, the air inside the jar increased by 18(DEG) C. To tal of 42(DEG) C. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise wo uld be too high."
26108,10,1,2,"white :: White would be the best because then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it would nt get as hot as black, dark grey, or light gray."
26122,10,2,2,dark gray :: the dark gray will keep the inside of the dog house warm enough in the winter and not to hot during the summer. the dar k gray was an average of 48(DEG)C which is not as hot as the black lid w hich was an average of 53(DEG)C and not as cold as the light gray which was and average of 45(DEG)C.
26126,10,1,1,light gray :: Because you dont want the dog house to be to cool or to warm.
26128,10,0,0,black :: the color might affect the dog house by attra cting the heat to it
26131,10,0,0,white :: The color that might affect the doghouse is t he white beacuse it was the one that got less then the other three colors
26132,10,2,2,"light gray ::  Light gray would be the best choice, because you don't want the dog house to cold, but you dont want it to warm. And the average temperature for the light gray was 45(DEG)C which is just right for a dog, because you don't want your dog to get to hot. And the black wouldn't be a good color, because darker colors absorb more energy. And there was an eight degree difference between the black lid and the light grey lid, making the light grey lid, the cooler, better choice."
26141,10,0,0,light gray :: if the color are ligth gray than the dog hous e the doghouse will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz i t light...
26144,10,1,1,black ::  This color would help keep the inside of the doghouse warm because the data has proved this. This would help during wi nter.
26145,10,1,1,"white :: usually a dog house is only used in the summe r so to keep the dog a little less cooler they should use a white paint. bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else a long with their heat. but blck has all the colors so it obsorbs all color s and their heat. so white would be best in the table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42(DEG)c. the average temputure for lightgray i s 45(DEG)c, the average temp. for dark gray is 48(DEG)c, and black's av erage temp. is 53(DEG)c. thats an 11(DEG)c difference. whitch could be very important."
26148,10,1,1,"light gray :: The doghouse should be light gray because tha t way the air temperature isn't to hot or to cold, it's just about in the middle."
26150,10,2,2,"white ::  Choosing the lightest shade (white) is the be st colour to paint a dog house because in order to create an environment most comfortable for the dog year round, the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. Painting the hosue white will ensure that it st ays as cool as it can over summer, thus making it the most comfortable fo r the dog. The white house will remain coolest because as according to th e data collected, the average temperature will be aprox. 42(DEG) C, whil e for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures (45(DEG) LGray, 48(DEG) DGray, 53(DEG) Black). The white colour was 11(DEG) coo ler than the darkest colour (black), thus making it the best colour to pa int a dog house."
26162,10,0,0,black ::  Has the most average.
26167,10,0,0,black :: it wold atracket heat or inorge frume t he sun
26168,10,0,0,dark gray :: It will become light in there because if you have dark gray it will infect the color from the outside
26170,10,0,0,white :: .
26181,10,0,1,white :: becase it reflax the light
26188,10,2,2,"dark gray :: the dark gray will affect the temperature of the doghouse just enough that the animal that's living in it wont freeze or overheat, because the dark gray color in the experiment didn't collect as much heat in the experiment as the black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray so the opposite effect wont take place."
26190,10,2,2,white :: i would choose white because it would make th e inside of the doghouse cooler than a dark color so the dog wouldn't hav e to be super hot in the sun. the average temperature for white was 42(DEG) after ten minutes and it was 53(DEG) for black showing that black makes it ho tter inside.
26193,10,2,2,black :: black because it well make the dog hous e warmer and the results to the black colr is saying it warmer.
26198,10,1,1,white :: painting the doghouse white will reflect the sunlight making it cooler in there
26205,10,2,2,"black ::  If Brandi and Jerry were to paint a dog house the color they should choose is black, because its the darkest color so it absorbs the most thermal heat. My theory is correct because in Bradi a nd Jerry's hypothesis ""the darker the lid color, the greater the inc rease is air temperature in the glass jar, because darker color absorbs m ore energy""."
26212,10,2,2,"light gray :: The color white might affect the doghouse, be cause the air temperature on the inside would be a lot cooler, but not to o cold and at the same time not too hot. When the lid color of the glass jar was black, the average air temperatuire was 53(DEG)C, after only 10 minutes, when the starting temperature was 24(DEG)C, which I believe mig ht be too hot for a dog living in a black doghouse. When their was a whit e lid, the average temperature after the same amount of time, and startin g at the same temperature of 24(DEG)C, was 42(DEG)C, which I believe wo uld be too cold for a dog living in a white doghouse. I believe the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot, nor too cold, because afte r 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24(DEG)C, it's average a ir temperature inside was 45(DEG)C."
26213,10,1,1,"white ::  white is the best color for the doghouse beca use lighter colors absorb less energy, which is shown on the data chart. it has an average tempature of 41(DEG)C versus the black lid which has a n average tempature of 53(DEG)C."
26218,10,2,2,"white :: White would make it cooler inside for the dog , Because it would reflect more heat instead of taking it in. Also, it wa s cooler inside because white's average was the lowest (42(DEG)) ."
26219,10,2,1,"white :: I think they should paint the color white, be cause white absorbs less heat than black does. Because if Black, Dark gra y, or Light gray were to be painted on the doghouse, that would absorb mo re heat than white would."
26224,10,2,2,"black ::  when the jar had a black lid the average temperature after 10 minute was 53(DEG), when the lid was white the average ttemperature was 42(DEG) because the black lid made the jar warmer the doghouse's roof should be painted black to keep the inside of the dog house and the dog warmer."
26225,10,1,1,"black :: Now the doghouse can be warm in the winter, b ecause 'dark colors absorb more light', and then the dog can just play ar ound in the yard in summer because everyone usually enjoys sun, even dogs ."
26226,10,2,2,"black ::  By painting the doghouse black, the air insid e the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color. In the experiment, the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53(DEG) , which is 2(DEG) higher than the dark grey lid, 8(DEG) higher than the light grey lid, and 11(DEG) higher than the white lids air temperature. This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it."
26229,10,1,1,dark gray :: dark gray may attract more heat to the dog ho use but no as much as black.
26236,10,1,1,"black ::  if the dog house is black it will increase th e tempeture of the air inside the dog house, making it warmer inside it."
26248,10,2,2,"dark gray ::  I believe that dark gray would be the best pa int color for the dog house. Although the temperature inside the do house would be warmer, it would not be super warm and make the dog overheat. A lso, the air wouldn't be too cold that the dog would freeze at night when he sleeps in it. Considering that dark gray had an average of 48(DEG) inside, it appears perfect compared to the white with an average of 42(DEG) and the black with an average of 53(DEG)."
26255,10,0,0,black :: it will usually always be 53(DEG) C in the dog house because that is the average tempature.
26256,10,1,1,light gray ::  The temperature of the doghouse with a light gray paint coating on it would make the doghouse warm but not cold or hot of a temperature of around 45(DEG)Celsius.
26265,10,1,1,"light gray :: Light gray would affect the doghouse by keepi ng it slightly warmer in the winter, and cool in the summer."
26267,10,2,2,"white :: If the dog house is white, then it will be co oler. Since the white lid made the inside of the jar 42(DEG)c, and the b lack lid made the inside of the jar 53(DEG)c then we know that white wil l make the doghouse cooler."
26268,10,1,1,black :: by making the doghouse black it would absorve heat energy that will make the doghouse warmer than if it was a lighter color.
26277,10,0,0,light gray ::  the dog might not be able to see it in the ni ght.
26287,10,0,0,black ::  Black will affect the doghouse because dark c olors absorb more energy.
26290,10,1,1,light gray :: Would make it warm in winter and not boiling hot in summer.
26293,10,2,2,"white :: White, because white reflects the sun and the doghouse wont get hot like it would if you use black. In your data it sh ows that in the trials white will be the least hot color."
26295,10,1,1,black ::  black because then in the winter when its get s cold whatever sunlight there is it will obsoub the heat and make it sli ghtly warmer
26302,10,1,1,white ::  i would say black because it exsord bes heat to make it worm inside. And th ey said the dark the color the greater the air temputure in the glass jar
26304,10,0,0,dark gray :: It will keep the doghouse's interior at an av erage temperature
26307,10,2,2,white :: The best color would be white because white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)c compared to the other temperatures. White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible.
26312,10,2,2,"light gray ::  Light gray will keep the doghouse cooler that black because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors. Dark colors do not reflect light well, instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures. In winter light gray will keep the doghouse slighty warmer than white would and it will keep the doghouse cooler in the summer."
26320,10,2,2,"white :: White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer. the average temperature of the white-lid-jar was 42(DEG), while the averge temperature of the black-lid-jar was 53(DEG). the white was 11(DEG) cooler, so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer."
26328,10,1,1,"light gray ::  I think light gray paint would work best to paint the dog house because in the summer black would be way to hot for the dog. The dog would feel most comfertable in a light colerd house in t he summer so that it is a comfertable tempuature. But in the winnter white would be to cold and the dog would freeze. The dog would want to be warm in the winter. In the expirament the black heated to 53(DEG)C an d the white heated to 42(DEG)C witch is a difference of 11(DEG)C. That is why the dog house should be light gray insted of black, white or dark gray."
26331,10,1,1,"black :: black might affect the doghouse because its going to be dark,hot, and not cmfortable."
26334,10,2,2,"black :: Black will make the doghouse to hot. The dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable. I n the lab, the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed."
26339,10,1,1,black :: black will keep the dog warm but if you live in a hot area than white
26340,10,2,2,light gray :: the dog house color should be light gray beca use in the lid experiment the hottest color was black and the coolest col or was white .i chose light gray because you dont want the dog to be to c old in the dog house because in thelid experiment the coldest lid w as the white lid and the average temperature for that lid was 42(DEG)!so i though is stead of having the dog house that cold why not have it ligh t gray because the average temperature for the light gray lid turned out to be 45(DEG)
26341,10,2,2,"white ::  it should be white because in the experiment, the white lid had the lowest air tempeture. you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer."
26343,10,2,2,white :: I chose white because the white was the coole st in all 4 trials. The white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool. On hot days the dog would stay cool.
26344,10,1,0,white :: if they pick white then the dog will be more cold than if they picked black this is because the darker colors like bla ck and gray take in more heat and energy and if they pick white it takes in less heat and energy so therefor Brandi and Jerry should pick a dark c olor
26351,10,2,2,"white :: White would be the best color for the dog hou se because in the experiment the data in the chart shows that white kept the coolest temperature of 41(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44(DEG)C, dark gray had the second hottest temperature of 48(DEG)C, and black had the hottest temperature of 54(DEG)C."
26356,10,2,2,black :: it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
26357,10,1,1,black ::  dark grey keeps a consistant heat level so it will not get super hot or cold in hot and cold seasons. this will keep a dog more comfortable.
26359,10,1,1,white :: The color white would effect the dog house by making it cooler inside.
26364,10,1,1,white ::  white has less energy absorbed so it will coo l down better than black would.
26370,10,2,2,"light gray ::  The color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse. During the experiment, light grey had an average of 48(DEG)c, compared to black whos average was 53(DEG)c and white whos was 42(DEG)c. Light grey would affect the doghouse becasue it is a color that soaks up heat but not so much that it would overheat the doghouse."
26371,10,1,0,white :: so it dosent get hot in the house
26372,10,2,2,"white ::  The dog house will remain cooler in the summe r. The white lid only had an average of 42(DEG)C in the jar, while the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C in the jar."
26375,10,2,2,"white ::  If Brandi and Jerry chose white as the color for their doghouse, then it'll affect the temperature by it being much cooler inside, rather than a black or dark gray color which would make it much warmer."
26380,10,2,2,"white :: A white doghouse would make the inside of tha t doghouse cooler in the summer, but it wouldnt make it as warm in the wi nter, since in the expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color of lid."
26381,10,1,1,dark gray :: This color will make the temperature in the d og house will cause the dog house to stay cool but also collect heat. In the experiment the dark gray got up to 48(DEG)c .
26386,10,1,1,"black ::  This color will make the doghouse absorb more light. Because it is black, heat will absorb on this faster then dark gr ay, light gray, or white."
26388,10,1,1,light gray ::  I chose light grey because it will still attr act heat and absorb some but not a ton. This way the dog house will be at the right tempature and out of the sun. Choosing a light color for this will be good for spring summer fall or those winter days when the sun comes out. It will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it light grey.
26394,10,2,2,light gray :: light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold. at black the temperatu re was 53(DEG)c and at white the temperature was 42(DEG)c. but at light gray it was 45(DEG)c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold.
26401,10,2,2,"white ::  white would affect the color by not letting the dog house heat up because with the data the result was, the darker the color the more heat so the color white would keep the dog house nice and fresh."
26403,10,2,2,"white :: white made the jar the coolest on average in the experement at 42(DEG)C. while black, on average, made the jar the ho ttest at 53(DEG)C. so if you painted the dog house white the temperature inside the dog house should be cooler than if you painted it black, dark gray, or light gray."
26407,10,1,2,white :: This way the doghouse will stay cool since th e jar with the white lid had the average temperature or 42(DEG) C.
26415,10,1,1,"white ::  As shown in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, wh ite absorbs less light than the other colors. If the doghouse is painted white, than the air temperature will be less inside of the doghouse, so t he dog will be cooler inside of the doghouse."
26418,10,0,0,white ::  dark colors atract heat lighter colors reapel heat
26421,10,1,1,light gray :: light grey would work good because its almost in the middle and maintains a good temperature so it doesnt get to hot b ut not to cold
26427,10,0,0,black :: i think black would be the best color because when it was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it had the highest scor es.
26429,10,1,1,white ::  i chose white because the dog could go in the dog house and not get to hot from the heat of the sun because white does not catch heat as easaly as black.
26433,10,2,1,white :: I think white might be the best color for the dog house because when it's sunny out the temperature inside the dog hou se will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white i s cooler proving that it absorbes less heat.
26439,10,0,0,black ::  Black because it effect lid color on the air temperature and because it absob more energy.
26443,10,1,1,light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse by makin g the doghouse not too hot and not too cold for the dog; a comfortable te mperature for the dog.
26446,10,1,1,"light gray ::  i choose light gray because in the winter gra y is kinda dark it will be warm, and in the summer it will be cool cause of the light gray."
26451,10,1,1,light gray :: it will help yhe dog house becuase in the sum mer it wont be to hot and then in the winter it will kepp it warm a littl e
26452,10,2,2,"black :: This color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors. Dark gray's average temperature was 48 d egrees celcius, light gray's average temperature was 45 degrees celcius, and white's average temperature was 42 degrees celcius."
26453,10,1,0,light gray :: If you use a light gray paint then the inside of the dog house wont be super hot for the dog
26457,10,1,1,dark gray ::  It makes the house pretty hot so the dog won't get cold but it's not so hot that the dog will get too warm
26463,10,1,1,light gray :: I think it wuold be light gray because dogs d ont like to be that warn and not that cold.
26468,10,1,1,white ::  It will affect the doghouse because i won't be as hot inside if its painted white but if its painted black or another color it will be hotter inside.
26472,10,0,0,white :: This is the best possible paint color for a d oghouse for the summer. But for the winter it would be black.
26474,10,1,1,white ::  The white paint would make it colder in the doghouse on hot summer days.
26477,10,1,1,black :: Darker colors attract and absorb more light s o if you paint the doghouse black then the sun's rays will hit the house and cause the black paint to absorb the light and keep the dog house warmer.
26480,10,2,1,"black :: i chose black because the average inside temp erature after ten minutes was 53 degreee celcius, so then the dog house w ould be warmer for the dog."
26483,10,0,0,"white ::  White will affect the doghouse because its average of air temperature inside a glass jar for 10 minutes was 42(DEG), while light gray was 45(DEG), dark gray was 48(DEG), and black was 53(DEG) ."
26494,10,2,2,black :: this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer. the black colored lid is 9(DEG) warmer than the white col ored lid.
26507,10,1,1,black ::  Black would affest the dog house becasue the sun attracts to black very easily and will make the dog house very hot on the inside.
26534,10,0,0,white :: i think white because it would keep the most heat out
26537,10,2,2,"white :: the dog house should be white because the col or white, deflects the heat waves so the inside of the dog house would be cooler. If the dog house was painted black, it would absorb more heat wa ves and then the dog house would get hotter."
26559,10,1,1,black :: black would be the best color to use so that the dog will stay warm. the average tempature using black was 53.25(DEG) C
26568,10,2,2,light gray :: light gray because it wouldn't be that hot in the summer time and in would not be that cold. becaue in the results the average for light grey was 45(DEG).and that in perfect tempature
26570,10,1,1,"white ::  The lighter the color is, the more light ener gy it reflects. If most of the light energy is reflected, the less hotter it will be inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting."
26585,10,2,2,"light gray :: Light gray will affect the doghouse because, based on the data the light gray color was the second coolest at an avera ge of 45(DEG). This will help because during the summer when it is hot, it will keep the doghouse cooler. But, it will also help during the winte r and keep the dog house warmer."
26587,10,2,2,"white :: the color white may affect the doghouse in a better way than the other three colors because according to the dat a table the lid color black, dark gray, light gray, all had higher air te mperatures. the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar. therefore, white would be a better color for the doghouse becau se the air temperature inside of the doghouse would be less than the othe r three colors."
26591,10,2,2,white :: White will keep the doghouse more chill than black or dark gray cause of their hot temps..when white has a temp of 42 degrees celcius..keeping the doghouse nice and cold..
26592,10,1,1,white ::  I think the color for the doghouse should be the color white because it doesnt attract heat and if we were to choose the black color inside the doghouse it would be hot .The black color's average is 53 and the white colors average is 42.
26601,10,0,1,dark gray ::  the color affect the dog house because with dark gray the temperature is kept the same instead of varying from one temp to the other. Plus dog dont want it to be too cold in there dog house so i figured they want a temperature that will keep them warm and kinda chill
26609,10,1,1,black :: it wil heat the dog house up more than the ot her colors.
26621,10,1,1,dark gray :: The color will affect the dog house by keepin g it warm in winter and not so hot in summer.
26624,10,0,0,white :: white so it doesnt get hot in there when its summer. cause darker colors attract heat
26625,10,2,2,"light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse because when the weather is warm outside the doghouse will stay cool but also be a bit warm. Also, when the weather is cold outside the doghouse wil l be warm but aslo a bit cool. I know this because when the light g ray lid was used on the jar the temperature inside the jar was average an d stayed cool. However the lid was also a bit warm. The lowes t temperature inside the glass jar with the light gray lid on was 44(DEG)C while the highest was 46(DEG)C which, if this is the sa me with the doghouse will make the doghouse feel like a great temperature ."
26627,10,1,1,"black ::  The darker the color, the warmer it will be i nside of the doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more energy."
26629,10,1,1,black :: the inside of the doghouse would be much warm er inside the doghouse then the other colors. the black attracts more hea t.
26640,10,0,0,white :: The white paint will keep the dog house warm in the winter but won't be too hot in the summer. The average temperture of the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This way the dog will be comfortable in the house with the white paint color.
26645,10,1,1,black ::  in the summer it can make the inside of the d og house hot.
26650,10,1,1,dark gray ::  This color will absorb enough energy to where the air temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot.
26654,10,1,1,light gray ::  light gray is a good color because it will ke ep the inside of the dog house not soo hott and not soo cold it will keep it warm.When the sun hits the god house it will not make it really hot a s it would if it were black or dark gray.
26655,10,2,2,black :: i chouse black becase black makes it hoter nd that will affect the doghouse by making it hotter....in the expiriment i t showed that black is hotter.
26662,10,1,1,light gray :: the doghouse would not get too hot
26664,10,1,1,white ::  white will keep the dog cool in the summer. s o the dog house wont be super hot it will be cool enough to be in comfurt ably for the dog.in the winter it will just be a normal temperature.
26670,10,1,1,dark gray :: i think it should be dark gray becuase when i ts summer the color will absorb heat so he cant say nice and warm and coo l at the same time..
26675,10,2,2,"white :: The color white will effect the inside of the doghouse because it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot. For example, when the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to abou t 42(DEG)C but when the black lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 53(DEG)C."
26703,10,2,2,"black :: If they choose to paint the dog house black, it will affect it by absorbing more heat energy. In the investigation, th e average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG)C versus the white wh ich had an average of 42(DEG)C. Therefore, if Brandi and Jerry paint t he dog house black, it will absorb more heat energy than the other colors ."
26707,10,2,2,"light gray :: Light gray would be the best color for the do ghouse because it would not be too hot or too cold because in the expiram ent, the jar with light gray lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C after 10 minutes under the heat lamp which was not as cold as the white l id (42(DEG)C) and the light grey lid did not have as hot of an average a ir temperature after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid (48(DEG)C) or the black lid which was 53(DEG)C. With the light grey roo f, the dog would not get too hot or too cold in it's doghouse."
26708,10,2,2,"white ::  It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature. It was 42(DEG)C, 43(DEG)C, 41(DEG)C, and 42(DEG)C."
26711,10,0,1,black ::  Black might affect it because the darker the color the the more energy it absorbs.
26715,10,1,0,dark gray :: in winter the doghouse will stay warm in the summer the doghouse will stay cool.
26716,10,1,1,black ::  In the summer the dog house will be hot but in the winter the dog house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat.
26720,10,2,1,dark gray :: I think that Brandi and Jerry should use dark grey for the dog house paint color.Dark grey would keep the temperature between the highest and the lowest temperature.Dark grey would be the bes t because the black dog house would get to hot for the dog at an average at 53(DEG)c and the white dog house would be to cold for the dog at an a verage of 42(DEG)c so i picked the dark grey dog house because it was in the middle at 48(DEG)c. The light grey house would be my next choise at an average of 45(DEG)c.The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3(DEG)c away from each other and i picked the dark grey because if it g ot colder the dog house would still stay warm enough for the dog.
26726,10,1,0,white ::  i choose white because black and grays suck in alot of heat and white reflects it so white is less hot.
26728,10,0,0,dark gray :: it wwould make the dog house a good temperatu re
26731,10,2,1,"white :: White has the least temperature on the data t able and it is the lightest color. Like their hypothesis said ""Darke r colors absorb more heat than lighter colors"". So white is the ligh test color there is. So that means that the white doghouse wont absorb an y heat like the black, dark gray, and light gray doghouses."
26740,10,0,0,"white :: They Should Paint the Dog house White. If The Dog House Was whiteAnd It was a sunny day, then the dog would be hot.(do gs cant sweat.)"
26742,10,1,1,dark gray ::  it will not make it too hot for the dog or to cold for the dog
26748,10,0,0,light gray :: The light gray color will keep the room bothe cool and warm at the same time
26749,10,2,2,"light gray ::  black absorbs more heat, therefore it will be too warm in the dog house, white on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see on the data table. During trial 1 white was 42(DEG) while black was 54(DEG). So if the roof is white the dog will too cool. Therefore th e dog house should be light grey, it is a happy medium. On cool days it w ill still be warm because grey absorbs more heat than white, and on hot d ays it wont be too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black."
26751,10,1,2,"dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse dark gray, then when the dog would be inside the doghouse it would not be hot, but it would not be cold, either. From the investigation for the air temperature, the average of all the averages combined is 47. The closest color to that temperature is dark grey. Therefore, the color dark grey is just the right temperature because it's not too not, and not too cold. The dog inside the doghouse would be perfect in this temperature."
26754,10,1,1,white :: if you have a white houes les heat will be at racted to the houes because it is a lighter color but to a dlack houes mo re heat will be atracted
26756,10,1,1,"light gray :: The color might affect the dog house becuase dark colors attrack sunlight so black would be hotteer then dark gray, wo uld be hotter then light gray, and light gray would be hotter then white. White would have the coldest tempature in the dog house and black would be the hottest."
26766,10,1,1,"dark gray :: Using the dark gray paint would be best becau se it was closest to the average temperature of all of the colors. The do ghouse temperature would be warm, which is good for the winter and most s easons."
26782,10,2,2,"white :: The doghouse should be white because then the temperature inside the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day because accoring to experiment and the data table, ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature,"" the glass jar with the white lid was the least affecte d by light. For example, the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after ten minutes was 42(DEG)C, while the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after ten minutes was 53(DEG) C."
26792,10,1,1,"dark gray :: According to the experiment, BLACK would be t he best and most effecient color (in the pretense that you would want it to be warm inside the doghouse, that is). But, the case is, during the summer, it gets very warm, and what happens if you paint the dog's house BLACK? Well, that col or magnifies the sun's heat, and you would indirectly scorch your poor do g. Usually, though, the heat here is cold and not hot, so the best color for the dog house would be DARK GRAY, because during the Summer and heat, your dog wouldn't be too h ot, and during the colder times, it will still keep the heat in well."
26793,10,2,2,"white :: If the color of the doghouse is white, this w ill keep the house cool. According to the experiment, the black lid incre ased the air temperature by 29(DEG)C in 10 minutes, while the white lid only increased it by 18(DEG)C."
26802,10,1,0,"dark gray :: Dark grey because, in the winter the dogf mig ht get cold soit would be warmish inside of the doghouse for the dog and in the summer the dog might not even go in its doghouse it will probably want to lay out in the sun but in the summer at night it is the perfect t empeture to sleep in the doghouse."
26807,10,1,1,"black ::  black because the coloe might get lighter and then darker and then lighter and then darker, it will affect the doghous e because the house may become warm inside by the heat the black is bring to it"
26809,10,1,1,white :: It affects the inside of the dog house becaus e if white is the color outside then on the inside it will be much cooler than black or d ark gray since darker colors aborb more heat.
26812,10,2,2,black :: That color wil affect the doghouse warming th e inside of the doghose because in the data the color black was ranging i n from 52(DEG)C-54(DEG)C and the lighter colors were in the 40(DEG)C
26816,10,0,0,"white ::  the white is not dark and not light, white is between that ."
26823,10,1,1,"white :: How the color white would effect the dog house is, if they painted it white it would be cooler inside the dog house. and if they painted it black it would be hotter. they should paint the dog house white so the affect makes the dog house cooler."
26833,10,1,1,"white :: I don't think the color on the outside would affect the inside of a doghouse if your using a thicker material like wood, but to be safe i would still choose white so the house would be colder"
26838,10,2,2,white :: the white paint will keep the dog warm but no t stifling hot. the paint had the lowest temp. of air in the lab as white doesn't attract heat like black does
26840,10,1,1,"light gray :: the light gray because than i wont get to hot in the doghouse when its sunny out side because it wont absorb to much e nergy, but when its cold outside it will still be a little warm because i t absorbing energy, so it would always be the perfect temperature for the dog"
26842,10,1,1,white ::  Brandi and jerry should use white because it absorbs less heat than the darker colors.
26845,10,2,2,"light gray :: I chose light grey because the inside of the dog house wouldn't be too hot for the dog, or too cold. According to the data, the result of light grey had an average temperature of 45(DEG) C w hile the black paint would be too hot at an average of &#8776; 53(DEG) C and the white paint could maybe be too cold with an average temperature of 42(DEG) C"
26854,10,1,1,"light gray ::  During the summer, the doghouse will stay a l ot cooler than it would with it painted black, but in the winter, it woul d be better to have light gray so that the doghouse would be warmer."
26857,10,0,0,light gray :: i dnt know
26862,10,2,2,light gray ::  I chose light gray because then the dog house won't be too cold or too warm with light gray. Light gray was in the mid dle of the data. White would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot. The average temperture for white was 42(DEG)C and the average temperture for black was 53(DEG)C. Light gray was the perfect ch oice because it's average temperture is 45(DEG)C.
26863,10,1,2,white :: In the data table it shows The black lid Held in more hot air then all the other lids Black lid held in : 54 (DEG)c on trial 1 whi le the white lid held in : 42(DEG)c in the first trail the black lids average was 53(DEG)c while th e white lids average was 42(DEG)c by comapreing the data it shows that the whit e lid holds in less air.
26869,10,0,0,dark gray :: that would help even it out.
26875,10,1,1,dark gray :: I think dark gray is good because the t empeture is 48(DEG) and that's not hot so the dog is not going to be hot .And 48(DEG) is not cold either it's cool so the dog wont be cold or hot it'll be just right.But that's my opinion.
26879,10,1,1,"dark gray :: How this color might affect the dog house is that with Black in the summer the dog house would get to hot inside, and with white in the winter time it would get to cold inside. I chose Dark Grey because it would not get to hot or to cold because of the weather."
26883,10,2,2,light gray :: Light Gray should be the cooler because in th e summer it wont be so hot because in the data the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or to cold.
26887,10,0,0,black ::  It would have more air in the doghouse allowi ng the dog to breath easier.
26897,10,1,1,white :: it would make it cooler cause the color isnt dark.
26902,10,2,2,white :: That color might help to keep the air tempera ture lower since lighter colors dont absorb as much energy as darker colo rs like black or gray. This was proven in the experiment because the aver age air temperature for white (42(DEG)) was lower than the average tempe rature for black and gray (45(DEG)- 53(DEG)).
26903,10,1,1,"light gray :: I think the best paint color is light gray be cause that way the temperature inside the doghouse will be warmer than th e outside, so it won't be too cold inside, but it won't be too hot like a black roof might cause it to be"
26914,10,1,1,"dark gray ::  If the dog house is dark gray, then the house will absorb heat to keep the dog warm on cold nights but also not to muc h heat so that the dog stays cool on hot days, because the darker the col or the more heat that is absorbed. If the color is not completely black t hen not to much heat energy will be absorbed."

26928,10,0,0,white :: my dog like white
26930,10,2,2,white ::  Because it had lowest temp after 10 minutes w hich is 42(DEG)C
26933,10,1,0,dark gray :: this color would deflect heat but also keep t he inside warm.
26934,10,1,0,light gray ::  it well keep it from getting to hot
26935,10,1,1,white :: White is the color most likely perfered becau se the color white doesnt absorb the suns radiations so it doesnt heat up as hot as others would.
26958,10,2,2,"black :: Painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most. In the experiment the average air temper ature in the glass with the black lid was 53(DEG)C, the glass with the d ark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the glass with the light gray lid was 45(DEG) C and the glass with the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This proves that if Brandi an d Jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint. Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse."

26962,10,1,1,white ::  Because white doesn't attarct as much heat an d therefore the dog would be a lot cooler in a white dog house than a bla ck one for example.
26964,10,2,2,"white :: White would be the smarter choice, because it reflects heat verses absorbing it. According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside. Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well, because during the day they would absorb heat and then at night when it cools down the doghouse is warm inside. Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house."
26969,10,0,0,black :: it wont be as hot
26970,10,0,0,light gray :: it can effect the ray of the sun
26972,10,1,1,"white :: you would probably want to choose white becua se that is the color that will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse, wh en the sun is shinning it is usually warm outside, and the dog will want to use it to cool off, not to get even more hot."
26973,10,2,2,"white :: The color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool. In the experiment, white had the average of 42(DEG)C, as for black had an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore, 42(white) is less than 53(b lack), so Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white."

26984,10,1,1,light gray :: i choose light gray because it is not to cold anfd not to hot just right.If i choose a darker color it might get to ho t for the dog and if it is a really light color it will be to cold and wont ke3ep him warm.
26985,10,2,2,white :: The color white is the best choice. It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture. This is proven by the data gathered by the trials. According to the data the average air temperature of a black lid on a jar was 53(DEG) C. When the lid was changed the white the temperature droped to an average of 42(DEG) C. This proves that white would be a better temperature control factor.
26986,10,2,2,black ::  Black would effect the dog house because it's a darker color and darker colors absorb heat which would make the dog ho use warmer inside. In the experiment when Brandi and Jerry put the black lid on ther jar the average temprature was53(DEG)c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the average temrature was only 42(DEG). In the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house.
26993,10,0,0,"light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house a dark gray because you dont want a lot of energy in you dog house, it sho uld be calm and relaxing but you always want some energy.The dark gray wi ll make he dog feel more relaxed, because in the experiment it says that the darker colors absorb more energy than the lighter colors."
26995,10,2,2,"white ::  this color would keep the dog house colder th an the other colors because from the recorded data, black's average temperature was 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 degrees celc ius"
27005,10,0,0,dark gray :: Dark Gray would be a good color for a dog hou se because it will keep the dog house warm during the winter and during t he summer the dog will spend most of its time outside its house. the results in th e experiment were 48(DEG)C solid so that is a good temprature for a dog house. not too hot and not too cold.

The average for the temperature was 53(DEG)c for black . The average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C and gray was 45(DEG)C. Also wh ite was 42(DEG)C. According to this data, black would make things hot."
27014,10,1,1,white :: if they used white the doghouse would be cold er inside then it would if the doghouse was black. the reason why it woul d be colder is because white reflects more sunlight than the color black. darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors.
27015,10,1,1,"white ::  The darker the color, the greatest increase i n temperature because darker colors absorb more energy. The white would keep the doghouse's roof cool on a very sunny day, since the light color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark colors."

27112,10,0,0,white :: it will make the avreag tempecher go down by 11 degrees
27117,10,1,1,white :: white because it doesnt absorbe light it refl ects it so thier for the in side of the dog house is not going to hot. Bu t if you use black the in side of the dog house is going to be very hot b ecause black absorbs light.
27121,10,2,2,light gray ::  Light gray would be best so that it keeps the inside warm but not too hot. in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color.
27126,10,1,1,white :: The color white would best suit the doghouse because the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that wa y the inside of the doghouse will not be over heated.

The white color of lid was the lightest of them all and had the smallest temperature 42(DEG) . I sugest painting the dog house white."
27137,10,1,2,"white ::  it would be best to paint the dog house white because it won't make the dog house as hot when the sun comes out. White won't attract as much heat inside the dog house, as we discovered in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature because it is a lighter col or. As the colors got darker, the temperature got hotter."
27141,10,2,2,black ::  i would chooose black for my dog's house brco use during the winters the dog house would need all the heat it could get so i would choose black. black is the best color to choose becouse in th e test it was an average of 11(DEG)c hotter!
27142,10,0,0,white :: WHite dosent absorb much energy compared to b lack. black absorbs the energy like crazy
27149,10,2,1,"white ::  White would make the doghouse the least temperature.The data showed that the temperature was on average 42(DEG)C. The doghouse would be a cool enviroment, instead of too hot. The doghouse would be a place for the dog to go when he is too hot."
27160,10,2,2,"black :: This color (black) may effect the inside of t he doghouse by making the inside of the doghouse warmer. I say this becau se in the experiment with the lid colors the black lid made the inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars. So, I'd pick the color black if you live in a cold climate, because the black color will absorb the th e light and make the dog warmer."
27162,10,1,1,dark gray :: dark gray should work just fine beacause its a little warm but not to hot and dogs like it a little warm so it would b e perfect for your dog
27171,10,0,0,white :: That will affect the doghouse becuase that wa y there wont be to much pressure in the dog house. Then the dog wil l be comfortable
27174,10,1,1,"dark gray :: i would go with dark gray, so that way it doe sn't attract lots of heat. But just enough heat so that way it stays warm inside, but not really warm."
27185,10,2,1,"black ::  the darker a color is the more heat it takes in, with the dog house painted black it will absorb more heat rather than if it was painted white which reflects heat. in the experiment when the glass jar had the black lid the tempurature was 11(DEG) higher than when the jar had the white lid, this proves that darker colors absorb more he at and that brighter colors reflecxt more heat."
27191,10,0,0,dark gray ::  dark gray will effect the doghouse tempature because the air in the doghouse will stay the same all the time.
27205,10,1,1,"black :: The darker the paint the the greater the incr ease in air tempurature in the dog house, because dark colors absorb more energy."
27206,10,0,0,light gray :: Different color affect the doghouse color aff ect the heat in the doghouse
27216,10,2,2,"light gray :: Light gray would keep the inside of the dogho use from becoming to hot, and it would still be a better color than white for cold nights. This is true because the average temperature for the bl ack lid was 53(DEG)C, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG)C"
27218,10,2,2,white :: The color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature. This color would affect the inside of the doghouse by making it more cooler so that the dog wouldn't be so hot in the doghouse.
27220,10,1,1,white ::  The average temperature shows that using whit e paint for the dog house will be the best choice for keeping the dog coo l.
27225,10,1,1,black :: cause black is the darkest color which will m ake absorb the most heat.
27231,10,2,2,white :: the white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse because the average tmeperature for color black was 53 d egrees. and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees. a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
27232,10,1,1,black :: well black absorbs light soo black absorbs he at which would keep the dog warmer .
27237,10,2,2,"white ::  if the doghouse is painted white the air temp erature will be lower than light gray, dark gray, or black. the white lid jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. the light gray lid had an a verage temperature of 45(DEG)C. the dark gray lid had an average tempera ture of 48(DEG)C. and the black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C. therefor white will help make the inside of the doghouse cooler."
27239,10,1,1,white :: because white its absorbs less energy there f or cooler air tempeture
27241,10,2,2,white :: it wil be the coolest one at 42(DEG)C and do gs have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghouse
27245,10,2,2,"light gray ::  This color might affect the dog house because in the summer, when it's really hot, the light grey will not get too hot and the house is cooler and not as stuffy for the dog to sleep in versus' the black, it would be immensely humid and stuffy in there. Also, the light grey is good for the dog's wellbeing because during the winter time, the temperature will be really cold, but it would be dark enough to keep warm. So in conclusion, light grey is the best because it keeps cool in the summer and it keeps warm in the winter. Some evidence is that in the experiment, the average for the light grey was 45(DEG) C and the average for the black w as 53(DEG) C. The light gray kept cool while the black did not. So durin g the summer, the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house. If they had a light grey house, they would have a nice cool house to lou nge in over the summer and it is a good way to keep warm during the winte r as well! Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter ."
27248,10,1,1,white ::  The color white is a combination of all of th e known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat while proj ecting the combination color that it produces.
27249,10,2,2,"white ::  The color white would be a good color for a d oghouse because it heats up the air in it the least. In the experiment, t he color white only heated up the air in the jar to an average of 42(DEG) C compared to the color black which heated up the air in the jar to an average of 53(DEG)C."
27255,10,1,1,white ::  the white was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be best
27256,10,1,1,dark gray :: it will not be to hot or to cold
27275,10,2,1,"light gray :: the color of the doghouse might affect the in side of the doghouse by the temperature inside. As shown in the data tab le of the experiment, the data shows that the average temperature is 45(DEG) C which when comapared to other temperatures it shows that it is not lowest or the highest its in the middle."
27289,10,1,1,white ::  The darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object
27291,10,2,2,light gray :: i pick light gray because after 3 trials of 24(DEG)c for 10 minutes it had an average of 45 which means that the temperature remained not to hot and not to cold.
27292,10,0,1,light gray :: black because it would get to hot for the dog and white because it could also get to cold
27310,10,0,1,dark gray :: During the summer the dog houses temp. would be 48(DEG). This would keep it cool. During the winter the darker color will help keep the heat inside the dog house.
27311,10,1,1,black :: black attracts more heat
27314,10,1,1,black :: it would make the doghouse warm due to the da rk color.
27321,10,1,1,black :: it will make it warmer for the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy.
27331,10,2,2,"white :: This color would make the dog house 11(DEG)C cooler than than if it was a black color. So the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house. In Brandy and Jerry's experiment the white lid was the coldest, and they said dark colors absor b more heat, so white would be an appropriate color."
27335,10,1,0,"black ::  This color would keep the doghouse warm during the nights and cold days, and if it is a hot day then the dog will be outside anyways"
27339,10,0,0,white :: it would reflect most heat because it absorb as much emergy as darker colors
27347,10,0,0,black :: the color might effect the inside because the color of the wood.
27349,10,1,1,"dark gray :: it will be warm in the doghouse for the winte r, but not to hot for the dog in the summer."
27356,10,2,2,black :: If they paint the dog house black the conditi ons in the house would be hot because the jar was the hottest when they p ut the black lid on the jar. So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color.
27362,10,2,2,"light gray ::  Dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42(DEG)C. In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well. Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53(DEG)C. However, even though according to the experiment,the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool. The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid, but only by 3(DEG)C, therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5(DEG)C cooler than the jar with the black lid. The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer, but remain warm in the winter."
27364,10,0,0,"black ::  because that way the dog wont be hot or cold, it would not be cold but it wont be hot eighter."
27366,10,2,1,dark gray ::  dark gray would heat up the air for a dog to a comfortanble temerature and not make it to hot like the black lid or make it to cold like the light lid
27370,10,2,2,"white :: The white paint would make the inside of the doghouse coolest because according to the experiment the average of each color are black:53, dark gray:48, light gray:45, and white:42."
27375,10,1,1,dark gray ::  I would say dark gray because when the sun co mes out you don't want your dog to be to warm but not to cold so dark gra y would work perfectly in my opinion.
27379,10,1,1,light gray ::  it might be less hot than a darker lid becaus e black absorbes the most heat.
27389,10,2,2,white :: I choose white because white is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house will be more c ooler. I know this because in the investigation it said white had 42(DEG) C which is the lowest while the black had 54(DEG)C which is the highest.
27393,10,1,1,light gray :: this would absorb more thermal energy while still keeping cool because of the lightns of the gray.
27394,10,1,1,black :: black will affect the doghouse because it wil make the inside hot.
27395,10,1,1,light gray :: The light gray would keep the dog house at a more even temp because its both a light and dark color so it would atrackt the right amount of sun light and repel just the right amou nt of sun light.
27398,10,1,1,white ::  i would make the dog house white because whit e dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog would not be so hot.&#916;
27404,10,2,2,"dark gray :: The color, dark gray, would affect the doghou se because it would stay at a pretty warm temperature. This way, the dogh ouse would be around 48(DEG). The doghouse would not be too hot (53(DEG) ), as it would be with the color black, but the doghouse would not be too cold (42(DEG)), as it would be with the color white."
27417,10,2,2,"black ::  The black paint because it will absorb more light energy causing the inside of the dog house to be warmer, keeping the dog warm at night. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG), while the white was 42(DEG). The black paint had the highest temperature out of all colors and was 11(DEG) higher than the white paint."
27435,10,2,2,"black :: We can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat. Knowing this information, for the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse, Brandi and Jerry should paint the house Black."
27440,10,2,2,"white :: it will keep it cooler due to the fact that w hite dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray, light gray and black. also, because blacks average (in (DEG)c) was 53 dark grays average was 48. li ght grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. leaving that white wi ll leave the dog house cooler."
27441,10,1,1,black :: black would be the best because it keeps the inside of the dog house the warmest and would keep the dog warm and not cold
27445,10,0,0,"white ::  The color should keep the inside of the dog house at a reasonable temperature. Based on the results from the experiment, the hypothesis was right about black soaking up heat through the black rather than white. So the white paint would work the same by keeping the heat under control and not letting it all in."
27448,10,2,2,"white :: The best color to paint the top of the doghou se would be white. In the experiment, on average the black lid absorbed 5 3(DEG)C, dark gray:48(DEG)C, light gray:45(DEG)C, white:42(DEG)C . The black lid absorbed 11(DEG) more heat than the white lid. By painti ng the top of the doghouse white, it decreases the amount of heat getting traped within the doghouse."
27452,10,1,1,light gray :: light gray because it wont make the inside of the dog house to hot because the dog already has a large coat of fur and dark gray wont over heat the dog house.
27454,10,1,1,white ::  so that the dog can be fresh not hot over the summer and its not too cold for the winter.
27460,10,1,1,light gray :: it can keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter
27462,10,0,0,black :: they sould use black because black keeps heat better than the other colors so the dont want there dog to get cold so b lack is the most affective color.
27464,10,2,2,"white ::  White would affect the doghouse because accor ding to the results of the experiment, Trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54(DEG), dark gray made it 48(DEG), light gray made it 44(DEG), and white made it 42(DEG). They should choose white be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest, that way the dog doesn't ov erheat."
27467,10,0,1,white :: This color could keep the doghouse cool in di rect sunlight. This could make it more comfertable for the animal.
27487,10,0,0,"light gray :: The light grey will effect the doghouse by ma king it more noticable and plus dogs can only see black, white and grey."
27490,10,2,2,"white :: Brandi and Jerry predicted that the darker th e lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar , becuase darker colors absorb more energy. Their hypothesis was correct. This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the bl ack lid after three ten-minute trials was 53 degrees but the average temp erature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three ten-minute tr ials was 42 degrees. Because black was the darkest color of the lid, it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest (and vice versa for the white lid.) Thus, because we don't want the doghouse to be overhe ated, the best color to paint it would be white because white would absor b the least heat."
27491,10,2,2,"black :: The color black will affect the doghouse by m aking it a warmer environment for the dog. Plus if it is a cold winter, t he doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer. The data table shows that u sing the black lid color the air temperature was clearly around 12(DEG) higher then the white lid, about 10(DEG) higher in temperature than the light gray lid, and about 6(DEG) higher in temperature than the dark gray lid each trial. The average temperature was 53(DEG)C for the black lid, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average tem perature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperatur e for the white lid was 42(DEG)C. It shows the black lid absorbs more he at to keep the doghouse warmer."
27495,10,1,1,"light gray ::  Light gray would allow the dog house to absorb heat, though not as much as black, so it would not be incredibly h ot, but it would still be warmer than white. Also, it wouldnt be as cold as the white, but would be cooler than the black. So light grey is the perfect color to be not quite hot and not quit e cold, and just the right temperature to make the dog house comfortable for the dog."
27497,10,2,2,"white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be white. Inside of the doghouse, the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but for the white lid, it was 42(DEG)C. The white lid made the air 11(DEG) cooler than the black lid."
27498,10,0,0,white :: white cause black makes heat worse and so i c hose white because every dog house is white because its easier to see in the dark and its comfy and warm.
27502,10,0,0,black ::  brings heat in the dog house
27504,10,1,1,dark gray ::  Dark gray would keep the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be too hot or to cold.
27507,10,2,1,"light gray ::  If you paint the dog house black then the in side will always very hot. Then when the sun is shining on it just like in the lab it says the ""the darker the color"".the gr eater the increase in air inside the doghouse. so i would not choose blac k to be the color for the dog house. i would pick light grey because it i s dark but at the same time it is a light color . when the sun is shining or giving heat to the dog house it will be warm but cool at the same tim e because it is a light color and a light color does not obsorve as much heat."
27514,10,2,2,"white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because it absorbs the least amount of heat. In Summer, you wouldn't wan t the dog house to be over-heated. The white color had an average of 42(DEG) C while the black color was 53(DEG)C, this is a difference of 11(DEG)C between the two colors."
27516,10,2,2,"white :: I think that white would be a good color, bec ause in Brandi and Jerry's expeirement, white gave a cooler temperature t han the others, so the doghouse could be colder than warmer."
27517,10,1,1,dark gray :: this color would allow the house to collect s ome heat without it being to hot. Since gray is lighter then black but no t to light.
27522,10,2,2,"white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse. It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is. Also, in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors. 42(DEG) C, 43(DEG) C, 41(DEG) C, and 42(DEG) C. Where as the other colors, black, dark gray, and light gray, all had higher temperatures. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54(DEG) C, the color black. To the lowest te mperature, 41(DEG) C for the color white."
27524,10,1,1,black :: The darker the color is the hotter the doghou se would be. The lighter the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would be inside
27543,10,2,2,black :: the more dark the dog house iis the hoter it will be in the dog house so if it was black it would be hot in it like in the experiment when the kid was black it was 53 dagrees c and when the l id was white it was 42 dagrees
27548,10,1,1,"white ::  The air temperature will be lower on average, because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the l owest."
27550,10,1,1,white :: white because white reflects sun and u want i t to be cold in a dog house for a dog
27564,10,1,1,black ::  the color black would keep the the dog warm.
27566,10,2,2,"light gray ::  A light gray paint on the doghouse might prov ide some heat in the winter, while not making it too hot in the summer. T hat is shown by the data, in the 20(DEG) C increase in temp. Dark g ray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer, because of th e average increases of 24(DEG)C for dark gray and 29(DEG)C fo r black. A white paint would not provide much heat during the winter, sho wn by the meager 18(DEG)C increase. However, on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable. the doghouse would not likely be made of glass, a nd sealed off from outside air curculation. Also, the sun burns many diff erent gases, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp, in addit ion to being brighter. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles. - a note: You could have interchangable roofs on the do ghouse, one of each color, and circulate them during the year, with white in the summer and black in the winter, and the other two scattered betwe en."
27575,10,1,1,"light gray ::  In all seasons the doghouse will stay at a comfortable temperature. In the warmer weather the color won't absorb as much heat keeping the doghouse cool. During the colder seasons, the dog will still have a warmer area, and with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm."
27588,10,0,1,white :: the black would affect the doghouse because t he sun is attracted to black. so if the sun is beating down on the doghou se to long it is possible that the dog could over heat of get very sick. something eles could happen to the dog that is sleeping in the doghouse.
