17120,7,0,0,"Rose is a good person and wants to do everything she can for the family. When she talks to Aunt Kolab, and when her Aunt offers to sell some baked goods, Rose feels a burden lifted off her shoulders.

17122,7,1,1,From this story I think the best trait to describe Rose is that she's unselfish.

17124,7,2,2,"I think that one trait of Rose that i picked up from her conversations is that she is very hard working. She shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her. She knows it is difficult and she knows that the outcome of her work will be better for her and her sister, but yet she still works reallyhard to get her brother to college.

In the story, it states that Anna says, 'You sound just like Mama.' This shows that Rose has the traits of a mother figure in their relationship. Since Rose is the older sister, she has to look over her little sister when her mother is gone."

17162,7,2,2,Rose is caring based on her conversation with Anna because of her walking in and asking if she is okay and poured two glasses of orange juice and talked.

Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'

I think this because when Rose's Aunt Kolab asked is Rose felt weighed down by her family,Rose didn't want to answer. Rose didn't want to answer because she was prepared to take care of the family. Im my mind that is really brave."
17185,7,0,0,One trait of Rose is she is very busy. You can tell this because she barely has time to right an essay because of her job.

17197,7,0,0,Rose thinks that money is very important and determines your overall state of wealth and her sister doesn't. In the story as Rose and Anna were talking Anna says 'Money isn't everything Rose' and then Rose replies 'Not if you already have everything.' And to me this is just like saying that Rose wouldn't be happy unless she had everything.
17199,7,0,1,worry is the trait that I think Rose based her conversation with her aunt Kolab on. Her aunt says 'Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.'
17200,7,2,2,"'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job,Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This is a quote taken out of the passage. Rose is trying to calm Anna down she understands that  its hard for her and it is almost as if Rose has become the 'mother figure' in Annas life.

Rose likes to put other people before herself. She is a caring person but she sometimes doesn't understand when it is to much. After talking with her aunt she realized that she couldnt weigh herself down with other peoples problems. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That quote is from the story, and that quote is what made me infer what type of person Rose was. She does her best to help people, especially the ones she loves, and in the end she is just weighing herself down. That is the heart of a true caring person, and not only a caring person, but a strong person as well."
17222,7,0,0,"One thing that describes Rose is that she is over worked and tired.  One detail is that most of her days had been too long, too demanding.  From school she had gone stright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, than stright home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper."

17239,7,2,2,"I believe that Rose is careing. In the conversation she had with her Aunt Kolab, about the dream, rose did not want to explain to her aunt the way she felt, because she felt that she would hurt her aunt by telling her the way she felt. I think that when someone puts someone elses feelings, or thoughts before their own is a careing person."
17241,7,0,0,"Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her."
17242,7,0,0,Rose misses her dad terribly but knows he's just doing this job in Los Angeles to help pay for her brother's education. Anna misses him too and she says she doesn't care about the money. She just wants her father back.

17248,7,0,0,"To me, Rose seems like a competitive girl. She doesn't want to loose. Meaning by that, the fact stating, she has to write a three thousand word essay. Rose says, 'Even if I win, I won't get to travel to sacremento to recieve the prize.' This means she wants to win. She won't give up on her dreams."
17249,7,0,0,"I think Rose is decribed as a hard worker an is exhausted. In the passage it replies, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'

Also with all the rsponsibility he had when he was there is now passed on to Rosa which is causing her to not have any time to do anything.
17255,7,2,2,"One trait that Rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others, and does not think about the affects on her. When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt, she must then do her homework. She does not have much time to do so, and is often too tired to even finish. This proves that she believes she can help make a difference for Paul, and that he will return the favor. Even though Rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college, she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part. In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school, but she knows what she must do, and is afraid of hurting her family. In the story, Rose is a hard worker, and respects other's feelings."
17256,7,0,0,One trait that Rose is dealing with is poverty. Rose feels she does not do enough to help. Rose's father moved else-where to get more money for the family. Paul is going to college trying to make it through. Poverty is sad to say is what trait Rose was stricten with.

Rose is caring as shown through the part of the story where she is cautious to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels weighed down by the support she offers the family.

For example, how Anna said she misses her father and that it seems like he's been gone for years but Rose said, 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'"
17276,7,0,0,"One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations would be Stubborn, I think that Rose is very stubborn and somewhat ungrateful. she is stubborn because she complains about everything, she doesnt take anything for granted and never wants to give up on what she wants. In a way its a good thing that Rose is stubborn because people cant take advantage of her and she wont stop trying something until she wins. But on the other hand she can hurt people and can be annoying. this is the trait I chose that best fits Rose."
17277,7,0,0,Rose is very weighed down by all of the stresses in her life. Her Aunt Kolab infers her struggling and offers to help Rose in their conversation at the end of the story.
17279,7,0,0,In the story rose felt lonely she said. maybe if her dad came home for a weekend or her mom took a day off to be with the girls and help them out with school work maybe she wouldnt feel that way.
17281,7,0,0,Anna dont really tell how she realy feels. In her conversation with Aunt Kalob she dont tell her how she really feels about helping the family.

17287,7,0,0,rose dreamed that she swam

17291,7,0,0,"In this story, Rose bears a lot of responsibility. Everyone in the family must work in order to pay for Paul's education which will help the family as a whole. Rose feels too much pressure and she tries unsuccessfully to convince herself that she is alright with everything. She is conflicted to say the least."
17292,7,1,1,Rose is a very caring person. She gave up basically her whole life just to take care of her family. One example of caring for her family that she portrays in the story is when she is writting her essay for the state competition and she gives it up because she knows that if she wins she wouldnt be able to go to Sacramento anyways. She would have to stay home and take care of her family.
17293,7,0,0,She is stuburn and wants things her way because she just rolled her eyes and stormed out of the room.
17294,7,0,0,"In conversing with her sister, Rose continually reassures her of the brightness of the future, attempting to laugh and sound optimistic. She herself takes on the task of writing the essay, an unnecessary burden on top of her numerous tasks, suggesting that she is trying to repress a feeling of doubt that she shares with her sister. Thus a prominent characteristic of Rose is her unwillingness to accept the desparation of her family's condition, taking burdens upon her to help convince herself that things are going normally."
17295,7,2,2,"One trait that descibes Rose based on the conversation between her and Anna is that she is helpful in many ways. To me it seems that Rose is more of the mother figure in Anna's life and is there for her when she needs something. She helps tries to help out with the money situation by working. An example of the book of how Rose shows this trait is when Anna woke up and came into where Rose was, Rose asked if she was alright and if she felt okay."
17296,7,0,0,"In the story Rose is hesatent to tell her feelings because she doesnt want to hurt anyone. She says'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'. I think that Rose is shy and that she wants to make things work for her family but she doesnt want to have to hurt anyone in trying to do so."
17297,7,2,2,Rose is a hard worker and worries a lot. Rose is very persistent. One example is in paragraph two. Im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do. Then how she has to work to help support her entire family.
17298,7,1,1,Rose is helpful.  She works to help support Paul and the rest of her family.  Anna and Aunt Kolab both talk about the problems that are occuring because of all the things that they have to do to support the family.
17299,7,0,0,Rose seems a bit overloaded according to her conversation with Aunt Kolab
17300,7,2,1,"One trait I found in this story about Rose, would be that she is caring. Her Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose is to caring about her Aunt's feelings to tell her the truth and crush her feelings."
17301,7,1,1,"Rose is a hardworker. In the beginning of the story, she explains going to school, heading straight to work for a four-hour shift, and then straight home to help make dinner. After all of that, she still has to do homework."
17302,7,2,2,"She cares for her family. When she talks to Anna she said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'"
17303,7,0,0,"Rose can be decribed as patient during her conversation with Anna.  When she tries to to explain to Anna why everyone is trying to work so hard to help Paul finish college, she calmly speaks to Anna, even though she knows Anna may not fully understand.  Even though Anna clearly did not understand what Rose was saying, she does not lose her temper or show any negative reaction towards Anna's retort at the end of the conversation.  Instead, she remains tolerant, which takes a great deal of patience on her part."
17304,7,2,2,Rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful. 'Rose didn't answer. If she to;d the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom' this describes her puting her familly before herself.
17305,7,0,1,"Rose tries to reassure her sister about their father working in a different place. When Anna says 'It feels like he's been gone for years,' Rose kindly breaks in that he has only been gone for four months, and that they needed the money."
17306,7,1,1,I think a trait that Rose has is caring. Rose is caring because she cares about her family and understands what things are going on and tries to help her sister understand. She also is like a leader to her sister.
17308,7,1,1,"She understands the importance of finacial need. When she stated that her dad moved away to another job that paid three times what he was making before, reveals that she has some intelligance in money."
17310,7,0,0,"There mad that their mom has to work so late.''Mamas not home yet is he', 'I hate how late she has to work'"
17312,7,2,2,She cares about her sister Anna. This is supported by Rose asking Anna 'whats wrong'? and 'are you feeling ok'?
17315,7,2,2,"One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstation with Aunt Kolab is that she is caring. That she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person. The statement that supports my answer would be 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom.' That indicated that she cared what she could have said would hurt her aunt and that her aunt could very well tell her mom. She was probably scared it would hurt her mother too."
17316,7,0,0,"Rosa feels that she weiged down by her family, and theres is not much she can do about it.  The floashback that involved her brother  standing on top of her in the water, sybolizes herfeeling weiged down and no able to get much help."
17317,7,0,0,The conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab was a good sisters relationship.
17318,7,0,0,"One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations with Anna is pessimistic. She doesn't believe that their life will get better as fast as Anna would like it to. You can see that by Anna saying that money isn't everything and her enthusiasm as she talks about how Paul will graduate college and help pay for their college fees. Rose acts accordingly and compares Anna to her mother, which shows that Anna and her mother are the optimistic characters of the story."
17319,7,0,0,"1. she doesn't like to see people disappointed or u- happy. for example 'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'"
17321,7,0,0,"I think that Rose seems lonely and that is why she has so much in her life. She works to help out the family but at the same time when she is home she does school work and helps out with supper. I think that she feels the same way Anna does but doesnt want to admit it. With her doing all of these things she has no time to miss her mom, dad, or even Paul."
17324,7,2,2,"Rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people. ''Anna,' Rose said.'what's wrong? You feel okay?''"
17326,7,0,0,Rose seems like a truthfull person because she tells Anna about their dad being gone for only four months and that he is making better money.
17327,7,1,1,Rose did not want to hurt her Aunt. She doesn't like hurting people. So she wasn't going to tell her Aunt that she felt so weighed down by what she was doing for her family.
17329,7,1,1,"One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. Whether she wants to do something or not, she still gets it done. An example from the story is the fact that she goes to school, works a four- hour shift right after, home to help her aunt  prepare supper, and then does homework."
17330,7,0,0,"Rose was very busy on a normal day to day basis. I know this because of how stressed she is that she does not have time to write her paper, because of school, work, preparing supper, and doing homework."
17332,7,0,0,"One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstations with Anna is that she knows how to push things to the side that she knows upsets her deep down and say what she thinks the true facts are.  One example from the story that shows this is when Anna and Rose are talking about her father being gone and to Anna it seemed like it had been years that he had been gone.  Rose jus responded with a simple answer of, 'It's only been four months.'"
17335,7,2,2,"Rose is a rather optimistic person. Although she is very stressed out due to the work she must do daily, she seems hopeful that all her efforts will pay off, whether it be for Paul, her parents, or herself."
17336,7,0,0,Rose feels very weighed down because she has too much on her plate and it drives her insane because she also has to do a bunch for her family too and she feels presured not to give up and to help as much as she can and I know this because of when she had that conversation with her aunt at the end she had her aunt explain what she was feeling in a different perspective.
17338,7,2,2,"Rose is very caring about her family. She sacrificed so much time to get a job and help pay, along with her family, to get her brother through college. Of course, it doesn't mean that she is happy about it all the time, but she still does care and wants to try somehow to help as much as she can."
17339,7,0,0,She don't like to her peoples feelings because she don't tell her anut the truth about whats really makes her feel weigh down by what shes doing to help her family.
17340,7,0,0,"Even if I win, she thought, I won't get to travel to Sacarmento to recieve the prize."
17341,7,0,0,To try to confort her the people that she see in dis stress. in the story she tries to make a  joke on how money isn't every thing to poeple that have everything.
17342,7,2,2,"She hides her feelings so she doesnt upset others, like when she didn't want to tell the truth and hurt her Aunt."
17343,7,0,0,It is easily surmisable from the text that Rose can be described as burdened.  It is enough proof to deduce her burdened and troubled mind set when the story describes her dreams as she feels that the weight of her brother is crashing down on her.
17344,7,2,2,"One trait that I saw in Rose during her conversation with Anna is that she is a positive person she is telling her sister the positive things that will come out of it. Also, that even though she feels weighed down by everything she is still keeping her head up and staying positive. For example, Rose said to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'"
17345,7,0,0,"Rose is a nervous person, she's saying, 'even if i win, i wount get to travel to Sacramento to recieve the prize."
17347,7,0,0,Rose is paranoid. She is paranoid with how her life is going with her mother working late and her father moving away to work somewhere else.  This is shown when she keeps having bad dream.
17348,7,0,0,"'I feel asleep working on my essay,' Said Rose                                               Rose was doing her essay and she feel asleep and had a bad dream and she woke up scared and Anna ask if she was ok and Rose said yaq i am ok."
17350,7,1,1,The one trate I would identify Rose with would be understanding. She shows this trait when she explains to Anna why Papa had to leave.
17351,7,0,0,I think she is desolate and worn out. She works all the time to help her family and has no time for herself.
17352,7,0,0,Rose feels overworked and wants an easier life. This based on when Aunt Kolab asked her if it's difficult for her to imagine life in Cambodia.
17353,7,1,1,"Rose is very responsible. She spends her days at school, then going to work, then preparing supper, and then doing homework. She is dutiful because she is trying to prepare for her future at college and helping Paul pay for his."
17355,7,1,1,"Rose has a great trait, the trait she has is will-power. Rose does a lot for the family and she doesn't really ask for anything in return.'Rose didn't answer one of Aunt Kolab's questions because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.'"
17356,7,1,1,Rose is an caring person who cares about others and how they feel and she is not self-centered. She is an trustworthy person and is very reliable. And she tends to be shy sometimes but she overcomes it a little bit.

17360,7,0,0,"Rose is very well at thinking before she speaks. In paragraph 19, she thaught about what to say because she did not want to hurt her aunt."
17361,7,2,2,Rose is a caring person. She wants her family to be well of and live a good life. She did not want to hurt her aunt by telling her that she felt weighed down by all she does. Rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father. I see Rose as a caring girl.
17362,7,0,0,One trait that can discribe Rose is she woulod like everything to be her way and if it does not go her way she does not wont to do it.'Ann is mom home yet .' 'Rose know i wish she would come home earlyer and not late all the time dad never did that and that would help me a lot if she came home earlyer.'
17363,7,0,0,"Rose is the type of person that is afraid to tell the truth if she thinks that it is going to hurt someone elses feelings.  The reason I say this is because in paragraph nineteen it says, Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probabaly her aunt would tell her mother."
17364,7,0,0,"When Rose is talking to Anna after anna pours two glasses of orange juice, Rose says that she is lonesome for Papa. He has been gone for four months which seems like he had been gone for years."
17365,7,1,1,She works really hard and its for her family. She would do anything for her family and they would do the same for her.She is over working herself though. She needs to get her essay done and work at the restaurant and help cook at her house. But she does it anyway.For her brother.
17366,7,2,2,"In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, we can see that Rose is tactful because she does not tell her aunt the truth for fear that she would hurt Aunt Kolab's feelings or that the aunt would tell Rose's mother and it would hurt her mother's feelings."
17367,7,0,0,"Rose is not a person who will easily express her feelings. In her conversation with Anna, she sounded like she was perfectly content and not stressed by the fact that she has to help Paul get through college. It takes a strange dream and some probing by Aunt Kolab to get her to reveal her true feelings about the situation."
17369,7,0,0,I think that at the end of the story she finally understandsthe strength of her culture and how her aunt was using it to make her feel better and lighter.
17370,7,0,0,One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is worried. She is worried that her older brother is going to weigh her down. The dream in which Paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer.
17371,7,0,0,They are both kinda upset that their dad had to go to Los Angelous for his work.  They both knew that he was making more money that ever.
17374,7,0,0,"she is a busy body, cause she always has stuff to do."
17375,7,0,0,BUSY'When would she have time to squeeze writing into her schedule
17377,7,1,1,"Rose showed that she is very understanding when she had her conversation with Aunt Kolab. As her aunt helps her think of other things and helps her keep her hope up by pointing out the bright side of things, Rose nods away at what Aunt Kolab says. Although she still questions it in her head, she understands that maybe there is still something for her in her future."
17379,7,1,1,Rose seems to be very kind. She didn't want her aunt to feel bad and also stuck up for her dad in her conversation with Anna.
17380,7,0,0,"Rose is a very busy girl. She has to deal with being in high school, having a job, helping her Aunt Kolab with house work, and she has to write a three thousand word essay."
17381,7,2,2,One trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring.  I think Rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad.  Rose tries to comfort her and tries to tell her that their dad had to go away to make more money.
17382,7,0,0,"She grew up here and here mom and everybody else grew up in Cambodia. She has a dream that her brother is a heavy weight sinking  her down to the bottom of a body of water, and that gives her the oppurnity to see the situation through someone elses eyes."
17383,7,2,2,"Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose can be described as caring because she puts her sister's needs before her own. Although she needs to write a three thousand word essay, she is more concerned that her sister had a bad dream and is missing their father."
17385,7,2,2,"One trait that Rose has is that she understands some things have to be sacrificed for the better of the family.  This appears when she is talking with Anna in the kitchen after they both wake up.  Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa.  It seems like he's been gone for years,' (para. 8).  Rose's response is, 'He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here,' (para. 9).  This shows that for her age and the amount of responsibility she has, she still understands that the sacrifice for a family is the most important thing of all."
17386,7,2,2,"Rose can be described by hopeful.  She is hoping or wanting more to come out of the future.  When Rose and Anna are talking at the beginning of the story, Rose talks about how once Paul finishes college, he will get a good job and help support the rest of the family and help pay for both of them to go to college."
17387,7,0,0,"Rose was nice to her sister at first, But then kinda got angry. In the story they were talking about their dad, and Rose made Anna mad."
17388,7,0,0,"I feel like rose is very stressed. In the second paragraph, the first sentence, rose talks about how most of her days were long and too demanding. Then it describes in the third paragraph how she doesn't feel like she will have time to squeeze in her essay."
17389,7,1,1,"Personally, I believe that Rose is sincere. She is trying to help her family, to the best of her ability, but she is heavily weighed down by circumstances. In this story, Rose goes through her to-do list for a typical evening. You would think that the list would be much shorter for someone her age, but then you realize what she has to sacrifice to keep her family going. I wish we could all have her sincerety."
17390,7,1,1,The one trait that Rose has is to work hard fo rher family to get by without some of her family memebers. I get this support because her sister and her have a talk about mone yand that her dad is gone and her mother works a long shift just to get money for them to survive.
17391,7,1,1,"One trait that describes Rose is a hard worker.  She goes to school every day, then goes to wrork, and eventually she comes home and only has time to do homework.  She still get everything done and that is why Rose is a hard worker."
17392,7,0,0,she isnt very happy
17393,7,2,2,I would say Rose is an understanding person. In the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family. She is understanding of why her father has to live in L.A. and why her mother has to work so late. She is trying to win a prize for an essay but realizes she might not be able to travel to get. She is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding.
17394,7,1,0,"Rose seems to understand that everything she is in the best interest of her and her family, but the pressure only weighs down on her more. This is prevalent when she is speaking with her sister, Anna. Despite the feelings of stress bearing down on her, she explains their current situation to her sister calmly and sincerely."
17396,7,0,0,"She seems iritated and tired, because in the story she wakes up and says oh, no and groaned. This shows that she is very unpleased and that she is very tired and irritable."

17403,7,1,1,"In the story the conversation with rose and aunt Kolab would describe Rose as a helping person. She dosen't mind helping out in the family but, meanwhile at the end of the day she feels exhausted and wish she could tell her aunt but not in a way that will hurt her or her mother."
17404,7,0,0,"Rose is dismissive and a little passive. She answers her aunt truthfully, but only with non-verbal communication. This shows shes dissmissve for the subject."
17405,7,0,0,"Rose appears to feel overwhelmed by everything that is thrown at her- a rough job, taxing schoolwork, and a homelife that takes up most of the time she has that would normally be free to anyone else. '...From school she'd gone straight to the  restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'"
17406,7,1,1,Well she is caring and nice.
17407,7,2,2,Rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to Aunt Kolab. She is caring because she didnt tell the truth because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or her mother.
17408,7,2,2,concernedi think she is concerned for her family and how her brother is the one that has to be the one that suports her and her little sister anna. she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late .

Also, whe talking to her aunt, although she said things probably won't get much better, she stayed on the plus said and said, maybe they will."
17418,7,1,1,"One trait that can describe Rose is that she cares about what is right for the family instead of what she wants because when Anna said she doesn't care about money and she wants Papa home, thats being self-centered.  Rose shows the positive side of her father being gone and just accepts it and is willing to keep helping the family."
17419,7,0,0,"Rose is unhappy, and supresses her feelings of how she really feels to make others feel better. She doesn't want others to see her as someone who can only take so much. An example of this is when Rose's sister walks into the room she acts as if falling asleep while working on an essay that is important to her is okay.

She supresses how she feels, because she doesn't want to sound ungrateful, nor does she want to make her family upset.  She hesitates about telling Aunt Kolab that she does feel weighed down by all the heavy responsibility being given to her, because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt, or have her aunt tell her mother. She speaks grimly to herself when she wakes up, almost discouraging herself from doing the essay she has to, but she doesn't agree w/her sister, because she feels it wouldn't be fair and her sister wouldn't understand her.  She is a very honorable, responsible, and helpful daughter, but she needs to learn to stand up for herself before she has so much responsibility that she can't take it all."

17787,7,1,1,One trait is that she is busy all the time but yet she is a hard worker.One detial that supports my answer is that she can barely squeeze in a three-thousand word essay.

17798,7,1,1,"Based on her conversation with her sister Anna, Rose seems to be quite understanding. When Anna complains to Rose about their father being away Rose takes the time to explain to Anna why it is their father is in that situation. Instead of instantly reverting back to her own interests Rose makes the effort to consider everyone else and absorb the whole situation before talking about it to her sister."
17799,7,1,1,Anna is understanding in what is going on with in  her family and how she plays a part in working through the situation.
17800,7,0,0,"In this story an example used to describe what kind of person rose is would be: 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job , Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'(paragraph 11, line 3&4)Reading this and the part of Rose talking about her job and school and home life makes me think Rose is a person that wants to succeed."
17801,7,0,0,She said that she just wonted to be like a fish and beeenin the water all the time. When she was talking to to her Aunt she told her she was just misssing her home country of Combodian.

17804,7,2,2,I would say a good trait to describe Rose would be that she is very caring. An example from the passage would be when Rose professes that 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' I beleive this quote shows Rose's willingness to sacrifice part of her own happiness to help her brother to gain his own happiness in life. Only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life.

17812,7,1,1,"Rose is a dedicated person with a kind heart which is obvious to see as she tries to justify her parents actions to Anna and won't risk answering how she truly feels to Aunt Kolab for fear of hurting her. Rose is more concerned with the well-being and feelings of others than her own, and it seems plain as day as you read this story."
17813,7,2,2,"She seems like she is overwhelmed. She has to do this essay for a state competition ('When would she sqeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'), help her sister calm down to go back to sleep('I just had another bad dream, Anna says. Rose talks to her until she exits to bed.), she has a job that she is struggling to keep('...and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.'), a family to help take care of('...straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'), and a lot of expectations to do as her brother did.('She felt too young for so much responsibility...imagining how her brother must feel.')"

17815,7,0,0,She is simalar to her mother.'Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table. 'You sound just like Mama.''

17823,7,1,1,"The one trait I would use to described Rose would be helpful. I believe Rose is helpful because she not only goes to school but she helps support her family.

Rose had a paper to write but she fell asleep because of the school day she had earlier and the four-hour shift she had worked at the restraunt prior to her coming home."
17825,7,0,0,A trait Rose has is believing. In the passage she is worried at first about her family and isn't sure if things will get better because her mom's never home and her dad doesn't live with them because he got a better job in Los Angeles that pays three times more than his old job when he lived with them.

17988,7,1,1,Rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things.

As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt."

18064,7,0,0,I think one trait that describes Rose is that she sounds like her mom.  When Anna and her are talking on paragraph 12 ' You sound just like Mama.'
18065,7,0,0,"I think Rose tries to help the family out a lot, but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her. While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded and fell silent. I think this shows that Rose is young and does a lot for her family/"
18066,7,2,2,One trait that can descibe Rose would be that she is opptimistic she keeps thinking everything is going to get easier. In the last paragraph she is thinking maybe my life will get easier.

18071,7,1,1,"Rose wants to help her family no matter the cost. This shows that Rose is an unselfish person, as stated in the story, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought. She felt too young for so much responsibility. Then she shivered, imagining how her brother must feel. Only three years older, he held the fate of two people--both his sisters--in his hands.'"

18085,7,2,2,"Rose is the type of person that makes the situation seem less difficult by holding her own doubts in from her sister. In a way she is protecting her sister and keeping Anna's hopes up. Her sister probably looks up to Rose so she needs to seem confident, so Anna won't lose confidence. But when talking to her Aunt, she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go. Because her Aunt has the role of helping Rose. And Rose helps Anna. And together, they can help each other have faith."
18086,7,0,0,"One trait that describes Rose is hopeless. At first in this story, Rose is talking to her sister and seems very down. She is explaining to Anna that maybe one day they will have it good. She doesn't even seem to believe her own words. When Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab she is also coming off as a hopeless person. Aunt Kolab says something that turns her attitude around."
18087,7,1,1,"Rose is a responsible, young woman who tries her best at everything she does, but is facing some tough times after Paul left. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand-word essay?'"
18088,7,1,1,"One trait that can describe Rose is hard working. Most of her days are long and demanding, 'from school she'd [go] straight to the restaurant to work a four - hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'"
18089,7,2,2,"One trait that decribes Rose would be caring. The way she talks to her sister, Anna, lets you see she cares about her.

In the conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't answer her aunt when she asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose feels that if she gave an honest answer to Aunt Kolab, her aunt would be hurt."
18106,7,0,0,"One trait that Rose described with her conversation with her Aunt Kolab might be that shes actually understood, her Aunt Kolab sees her stress and her fustration. Rose wants to do everything she possibly can but its too much for one person. Shes working at a resturante for four hours after school. Shes going to school. She helps her Aunt Kolab with supper and she finds time to do her homework. Shes feeling a bit stressed with her situation. When her Aunt Kolab realizes that Rose is working really hard and is fustrated with everything, she talks to her to try and understand or see if theirs anything she can do for Rose.

18110,7,0,0,"The first trait that I think of when I read this conversation is how caring Rose is. She has a lot of responsiblilities with her school work and her job. Although she seems very tied up all the time, she still finds the time to ask her sister how she is doing, and try to comfort her with her problems, while also encountering her own. We can tell right away that Anna is very upset, but Rose is acting very mature, and tries to help her in any way so that she will feel a little more relaxed. In conclusion, I feel that Rose was very caring. A person that can endure all of the responsiblilities that she has, and still be as caring as she is shows us one of her greatest traits, caring."

She is conflicted by her responsibility to her family and her exhaustion. the dream she experiences about her brother Paul confirms this."
18122,7,2,2,"One trait that describes Rose based on her conersation with Anna is, that she is sincere and cares about her.

18129,7,1,1,When Rose is talking to Anna she shows that she is supportive of her parents decisions.  An example would be when she supports her father decision to work in Los Angeles.
18130,7,0,0,Figuring stuff out. She has to write this essay and she does all this other stuff so she has to figure it out.

18137,7,0,0,"When Rose talks with Aunt Kalob, she listens to what she has to say. Rose makes sure to think about what Aunt Kalob is saying and takes it to heart.

18143,7,1,1,One trait that Rose has is that she can be very reasurring. An example is when she explains to Anna that their dad was gone for a very important reason and that they have an important part to do to help Paul finish college.
18144,7,1,1,One trait that can describe Rose would be hardworking. I would use this because thru out the whole story she is working on somthing if it isn't homework it is somthing around the house that she is doing.
18145,7,0,0,"Rose is stumped on if she could squeeze in the essay or not, and that if she tries then she'll be even more packed than what she already is with trying to help out her family already. Rose feels like she is doing her best, but that it also might not be enough. She doesn't really want to tell anyone about her problems either because they might make their problems a little bit more worse.     Aunt Kolab said, with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother."
18146,7,1,1,I would say that Rose is a smart girl. She seem to be a hard worker as well. Going to school then going to work and then making dinner for her family and in between doing homework. The one thing I see in her is that she cares about her family alot. She trys to tell her little sister that in the long run this will help her out. It takes alot to tell someone what they do not want to hear but it shows that you care for them.

Rose was given so much responsibility and it is weighing down on her, but she keeps striving to make things right."

18161,7,1,2,"Rose has an over-developed sense of responsibility as she is pressured to work herself into exhaustion to help support her brother.  She feels an obligation to work, yet she does not like it.  Her aunt asks her if she feels 'so weighed down by what [she's] doing to help this family.'  She suppresses her answer, which shows that she is embarassed by it so it must be yes.  Once her aunt offers to help support the family, Rose feels 'lighter.'  Her family's culture prevents her from freeing her burdens from herself and that causes her to become responsible."

I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working."
18168,7,0,0,"I'm not sure if being depressed is a trait, but I feel like Rose is very stressed out. When her sister tells her that she had a bad dream Rose completely ignore her. I believe that Rose wasn't ignoring her on purpose, but had her mind on a million things, and couldn't focus."
18169,7,2,2,"During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait."
18170,7,1,1,One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is she is responsible. An example of this is when Rose was talking to her sister Anna. Rose is worried about the family and how they don't have enough money while Anna isn't worried about it because she believes all she needs is family. Rose knows that if they want Paul to graduate college then they are going to need more money. That's Rose's main concern.

18176,7,0,0,she is lonely
18177,7,1,1,"Rose is vey independent, she knows what she has to do in order to have the life that she wants, and she will do whatever it takes. When Anna tells her that money isn't everythings, Rosa replies, ' Only if you already have everything. We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'"

However, she shows that she wants to appear mature to Anna, and instead of telling her how she really felt, she tries to look at the situation from a practical and adult-like viewpoint, and appears 'just like Mama.' Rose's responses to Anna, such as 'money isn't everything' show that she is unwilling and embarassed for Anna to see how she really feels."
18184,7,0,0,She want to tell her sister how she really feel. May be its because she does not want her sister to worry. She tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better.      When she is talking to her aunt she says nothing to her at all. Her aunt tries to talk to her but nothing. Exept at the end of the conversation she at least nodes at her aunt. She feels very overwelmed.

The fact that she has to work at the restaurant and come home and help with supper shows that she is doing everything she can to help her family through their problems. Even if that does mean that she cant always do what she wants to."
18194,7,2,2,"One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person. One example of this is when Rose is talking to her aunt, and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family. What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person. In paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how Rose is a kind person."

18398,7,0,0,"In 'Crossing Over', the author displays Rose as a helpful child, but one who keeps her feelings inside. Although she feels pressured by what she needs to accomplish, she does not complain to others or stop doing what needs to be done. For example, as she was speaking to her sister, she explained how they needed to 'help Paul finish college...and he'll pay for [her] and [Anna] to go to college'(Paragraph 11, sentence 3-4). Not once does Rose express her worry about the situation."
18399,7,1,1,"As is widely known, people do not always show their true emotions, for a multitude of resons. Even though her feelings told her otherwise, during her conversation with Anna, Rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest. Then, when speaking to her aunt, Rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family. What Rose has done, being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose, however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character."

18405,7,0,0,"From reading this story, I have come to find that Rose is a self-centered person. When young Anna came into the kitchen and told Rose that she had had a nightmare, Rose quickly changed the subject to herself by saying, 'I fell asleep working on an essay,' without giving a second thought to how her sister might be feeling."
18406,7,0,0,"The trait is that Rose kept an 'Open Mind' during the talks and ultimately found a topic for her essay, which pretty much worked out in the long run."
18407,7,0,0,"In both conversations they talk about being flustrated and weighed down with stress. Rosa feels she almost can't go on because of the fact her fathers gone and she's left to work. Rosa feels,' that she is too young for so much responsibility.'"

When Anna complains about their mother not being home and their father being away, Rose explains to her little sister why things are how they are in a gentle way. This shows compation and caring."
18412,7,0,0,"Rose was cautious. She didn't want to make a mistake that could result in someone being mad at her. One passage in the story that would support this conclusion is, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'"
18413,7,2,2,One trait Rose shows is caring. The reader can see this in the 19th  paragraph because Rose doesn't want to tell her Aunt Kolab what she really feels for fear of hurting her feelings.

This must be difficut for you. Yes?' This quote shows how Rose's aunt didn't see through other eyes, and had to have Rose point it out to her. The eyes maybe of a different person or a different culture, but she was seeing differently."
18420,7,2,2,"Rose can be described as consoling.  In her conversation with Anna, Rose attempts to make sense of the family's load to Anna who is distraught and doesn't quite understand the whole situation.  She justifies their helping Paul with college, by telling her how he'll be able to pay for them  to go to college once he has a job.

As a result, when she is talking to her sister Anna you see you get a little angry. This is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling. You can see this when she resonds to Anna saying 'Money isn't everthing' with 'Only if you already have everthing.' This is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure Rose is feeling to not only finish her essay, but to also make money for her family."
18427,7,0,0,"Rose is a very smart person who thinks of things differently than others. This is shown in paragraphs 10 and 11 when Anna says that money isn't everything, and Rose says only if you already have everything. Most people wouldn't think of the situation in that way."

18438,7,0,0,She wants to find something better for her aunt and whole family not just one person. Rose is not a selfish person which makes her trait outgoing.
18439,7,0,0,"From paragraph 19 I could tell that Rose is a very modest person. I got the feeling that she doesn't like to bother people. She even says 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' Therefore she clearly does not want to burden anyone."
18440,7,2,2,"One trait that can describe Rose is that she is outgoin and is a hard worker even if she is trying to help out a nother family member.  'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'"

18443,7,0,0,"She is very self-sufficient. While conversing with Aunt Kolab, she was very weary about letting her true feeling show. Aunt Kolab thought up the meaning of Rose's dream and asked if Rose felt that way. Of course Rose, not wanting any help or pity, avoided expressing her true emotions."
18446,7,2,2,"One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined. She is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do, but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother. Even though it isn't easy for her, she knows that in the end it will all pay off. Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college. One detail from the story to support this is that Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'"
18448,7,2,2,Rose seems very caring and always think about others. She is so worried about helping her brother go to college.
18449,7,1,1,Rose is a young girl having to squeeze in time for her school work while she has a job and also a younger sibling to take care of. Even though she had many things to do she still is caring for her family and is willing to do it all for them.

18451,7,2,2,"One trait of Rose's that was shown in her coversation with Aunt Kolab hit me like a speeding bullet. Respect. Rose has respect for her aunt and her family. She knew the answer to Aunt Kolab's question, but felt that she would hurt her aunt so she decided it was better to say nothing than something wrong."
18452,7,0,0,"She was afaird, she was afaird to tell her aunt the truth."

Rose feels the weight of a busy schedule, but the extra restaurant work provides her family with some money that they sincerely need."
18455,7,0,0,"Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her."
18456,7,1,1,"Through her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab one trait that shows in Rose is loyalness.  Even though Rose is weighed down by her school life, working, and trying to help out the family, she does all she can to try and get through a tough situation."
18458,7,0,0,"Anna is a very realistic person, and that is a good trait to have. She could easily be mad at her father for leaving her, but she realizes that their family needs the money, so she accepts why he left. Anna can see that her father is not leaving to get away but that he is leaving to help his family have a better life. She demonstraits this trait when she is talking to Rose and Anna says 'Only if you already have everything,' when talking about how important money is. Anna is realistic about how important money really is."
18459,7,1,1,"Rose is very dedicated. In the story it tells how she is overwhelmed with work and the essay she wants to write, but she still works so that she can support her brother Paul."

18463,7,0,0,ROSE DIDNT ANSWER
18464,7,0,0,Rose did not want to hurt her family by telling her aunt that she felt weighed down by helping them so much. She did not answer her aunt's question because she knew that the truth would hurt her aunt and her mother.
18465,7,1,1,"I believe that one trait about Rose is how dedicated she is to helping her family. In the story she mentions that she goes straight to school, then to work, home to cook dinner with her aunt, then does homework for the rest of the night, so this obviously shows she is doing everything in her power to help her family make it."
18466,7,0,0,"One trait that I saw was that she acts different around different family members, for example, she was talking a bit more with her sister than she did with her aunt."
18467,7,0,0,Rose seems like she would be dramatic as certain times. She said. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' When in reality he was gone for four months. Which is found in paragraph 9 sentence 1.
18468,7,0,0,"She is a very busy, and stressed out girl. An example to show is when she is trying to figure out how to fit in a 3,000 word essay, and work a 4 hour shift at the resturaunt."
18469,7,0,0,Well it was that time in the kitchen that can desribe Rose how she stood and stalked out of the kitchen.
18470,7,1,2,I think that Rose is mature. I think this because in the story she tries to help her sister with how she is feeling. Rose tries to help Anna out with the leaving of their father.
18471,7,1,1,"Based on the conversation between Rose and Anna, I believe that Rose is protective. In paragraph 11, Rose 'tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' It seems like Rose is trying to comfort Anna, without revealing what she truly feels. By covering up her feelings while speaking to Anna, I believe Rose is being protective and trying not to expose Anna to the way she really feels about her Papa's absence."
18472,7,1,1,"Rose is an independent person.  She can do things for herself.  She seems to like to appear tough to her family, like she has everything together, and she can get along just fine.  It seems that Rose does not want her family to know of her concerns for the trip she would to take or of her concerns for her brother and the rest of the family.  Rose is also caring deep down, and cares so much the weight of her caring weighs her down.     When Anna spoke to Rose about their brother Paul, Anna seems guarded.  She doesn't want to show her sister how she really feels about the conversation and her family's situation with her father and her brother.  Anna tells Rose that she sounds just like their mother because she talks of how they really needed the money for which their father was working."
18474,7,2,2,"Rose is very respectfull of her elders. When she was speaking with her Aunt Kolab about how she felt weighed down by the responsibilities put on her, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother."
18475,7,1,1,"Rose is a supportive sister. Rose holds back her emotions when she talks to her sister, Anna. Anna is upset about their father leaving and their mom being away for a while. Rose feels similarly about the burden of supporting their brother. She chooses to say that everything will work out to try and support her sister instead of letting her know her actual thoughts."
18476,7,0,0,"Stressful. When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay? 'I'm insane,' she said grimly as she gathered books and papers."
18478,7,1,1,Rose is kind of quiet. She is helpful but doesn't really say anything. Like when Rose and Aunt Kolab were talking she just nodded and didn't say much.
18480,7,2,2,"Rose is compassionate towards others. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'"
18482,7,0,0,"Rose is stressed out. She is in high school, and has to work everyday. She has too many things going on at one time. Her boss might fire her if she misses another day of work. She tries to stay positive, but it is really hard for her to because of the tremendous amount of stress on her."
18483,7,1,1,"When talking with her sister Anna, Rose acts very compassionately. Rose tries to act kindly towards Anna, and she does not want the younger girl to feel upset about the family's situation. After Rose admits that she misses Papa, Rose tries to rationalize the situation; she gently explains that he had to go to another job in order to support their family. By saying this, Rose attempts to make her sister feel less upset. Thus, Rose is quite compassionate."
18484,7,1,1,"Rose is a very caring daughter that just misses her father because, he is working in Las Angeles."
18487,7,2,2,"Rose is a very hard worker and cares about her and her sisters education.     'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'"

18491,7,1,1,I think Rose cares a lot for her family. Rose comes home everyday 'to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18492,7,0,0,In the story she felt she is too young to have this much responsibility for her family. In the story it says In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these.
18493,7,2,2,Very hopeful for good to come to her life. She is optimistic in that she wants everything to be better in her life and she tries to see that through Aunt Kolab and Anna. The hope with that she speaks of with Anna is that they must help Paul finish college so that he can send Rose and Anna to college. The hopefulness and optimism she she also sees in the speaking with Aunt Kolab. She finds what to write about in this speaking with Aunt Kolab.
18494,7,2,2,She has respect for her Aunt Kolab because when she did not answer the question 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' She said she did not answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18495,7,1,1,A trait that stood out to me the most about Rose has to be how caring about her family she is. An example is how she goes to lay down with her younger sister to comfort her.
18496,7,2,2,Rose is kind at heart. She knows she has a job to look out for her family. She says' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' This shows that she cares about her family.

Rose probably felt aot better after talking to her aunt, and now she feels like things might get easier."
18606,7,1,1,"Rose, the main character of this passage seems to be very grounded and down-to-earth. While many people may deem these as pessimistic characteristics, some value these as they are able to bear the hardcomings of reality when it comes time. An example of Rose's groundedness is during her conversation with her little sister. Instead of comforting Anna when she talked about missing thier father, Rose simply told her that it was neccessary for him to leave in order for them to send thier older brother to college."
18607,7,0,0,"Rose is open minded. The support is when aunt Kolab was making suggestions like sew for ladies, or even make special treats from their country and sell them, Rose was agreeable when she was nodding her head."
18610,7,2,2,Rose is a very caring person. She would not tell her Aunt Kolab that she felt weighed down by her family because she did not want to hurt her aunt.

18621,7,1,1,"Based on the conversation rose had with anna, i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost.the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him,but she doesnt really know if thats really true."

By keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn. Another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night."
18636,7,2,1,"Rose is caring because she is a person that would do anything to help her family. When Anna discusses her distaste for their mother working so late and their father not being around, Rose attempts to lighten the situation and make Anna feel better.

18647,7,0,0,One trait that could easily describe rose would be that she is stressed and somewhat anxious about everything she is doing at the moment and what more she would have to do if her brother wasn't there. I think she feels like she has a lot of weight put on her because of all the other things her family members are doing.

18714,7,0,0,What is only one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab? The one and only trait that i think could describe Rose is motivation.

18724,7,1,1,One trait that I can see in Rose is that she is the kind of person who worries about everything like when her and Anna were talking about how little time she had to do things because she had to work and that she had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was already about to fire her so she wouldn't be able to travel to Sacramento if she won the essay prize.
