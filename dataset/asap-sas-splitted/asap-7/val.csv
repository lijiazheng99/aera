Anna feels discouraged and resentful towards how hard she and her family must work to put her older brother Paul through college.  Rose reasures her that once Paul is through college he will pay for them to go to college. Rose selflessly suppresses her stress and anger for the sake of her sister."

In the begining of the story, we read that Rose feels very worried that she won't be able to finish an essay for class, do to the fact that her life is too busy work and and taking care of the family. However, when she is having her conversation with Anna, Rose takes time out of working on her essay and pours two glasses of orange juice for both herself and her sister. This suprised me a lot because of how much she stressed on her essay in the begining of the story. I believe that this little action shows that Rose is a strong and hearfelt person."

17766,7,2,2,"Rose is a caring person. One reason she is caring is because in line 19, she didn't want to hurt her family by telling them the truth. The truth was that Rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family."

Anna said, 'Money isn't everything.' Rose said, 'Only if you already have everything.' This shows that Rose is willing to sacrifice what she wants to do, in order to make her family's needs."

17952,7,0,0,"One triat about Rose is that when she tells about her feelings she doesnt really express them too much. Anna seems the same way, like if she does have alot to say and that she feels a certain way she doesnt express it well. Anna just keeps everything inside, like in paragraph 9-10, when Anna && Rose were having a conversation the topic about their father was that Rose felt he's been gone forever. An that the job he has now in L.A pays really good money than the job he had at home.

Like when she didn't say anything after her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by her family, she didn't say anything because she didn't want to up set her aunt but she secretly wnated to say yes."
18237,7,1,1,"Rose is a overcaring person. She care for her family and want to help, however the story shows that she is far too concerned and feels as if she must support the entire family by herself.     It is proven to the reader that this is true when she has the nightmare. She envisions the weight of her brother unbearable and she strugles to survive.

18277,7,1,1,I think one trait of Rose from the conversation with Anna makes her seem like she really likes her dad and wants him to be there but understands that he has to make more money for the family. I also think she is the one that is overwellmed with this essay and is stressed out.
