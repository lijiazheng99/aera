The story says that she came home from school and went straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift and then straight home to help with supper. She also had to do her homework. Rose was a hardworker and had dedication. She had to have dedication to do school, work, and help out her family. Rose may have had to do all these things, but she did her best at all them to help her family, and to make a better life for her and her family.",1
18892,7,"Rose is growing up too fast and having to take on responsibilities that she isn't used to.  She has to act like more of an adult than she really is so that her sister doesn't have to worry.  This is obvious when Anna says 'You sound just like Mama.' It shows that even if rose doesn't realize it, she is becoming an adult.",0
18893,7,"One trait the identifies Rose is that she has alot of fate in believe her family will hopefully come out of debt sometime and will not have to worry about money anymore. An example would be when she says that their dad had to go to Los Angoles for a new job so he could get paid more money and some day return, at the same time their brother is going to college and once his finishes and gets a good job, their dad and brother will help pay them two to go off to college.",2
18894,7,She loves money.,0
18895,7,One trait that can describe Rose is trust. She trusts her aunt enough to come to her and tell her whats wrong and it ends up giving her motivational help.,0
18896,7,"Rose is a strong induvidual, because she does alot for her family and stays strong for them. An example of this is in paragraph 11 sentences 2 and 3. 'She tried a laugh and that even sounded fake to her. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college' This shows that Rose is trying to stay strong for Anna and her family by supporting Paul.",2
18897,7,"The trait that I would give to Rose during her conversation with Anna is strength, because Rose is also upset about her father being away for four months but she decides not to get discouraged about it.",2
18898,7,"One trait that can describe Rose is open minded. Rose spends the whole time stressing about her essay and what she is going to do to support her family. In paragragh 23, Rose became more open minded when she began talking to Aunt Kolab about things she could do to be helpful to the family.",0
18899,7,"Rose is very responsible, and she wants her family to stay together. This is talked about in the story when she says That she needs to look at things through other peoples eyes also.",1
18900,7,"Rose is caring towards her sister. She gives her sister Anna a logical explanation as to why their father moved for work, rather than complain about how much she misses him too. In a way she is trying to comfort her sister and tell her that it is for the greater good of the family.",2
18901,7,"She is caring. She knows that Paul needs to go to college to get a job so that he can pay them back, but Anne just thinks about it now. Although, Anne is right about money isn't everything.",2
18902,7,That she is always worried about her school work and nothing else. When anna told her thath she had a bad dream all rose did was change the subject about the essay.,0
18903,7,"Rose is a caring person, and this becomes evident when she askes Anna if shes feeling okay after Anna has had a bad dream.",2
18904,7,helpful,1
18905,7,She wasn't very confident about what was gooing on with the essay and her dad.,0
18906,7,"she is shelfish. she only thought about herself and money. maybe we can find a way to do things diferently, a way better for you.",0
18907,7,"Hopeful     ''We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.''",2
18908,7,I think that Rose is sympathetic because when she was talking to her Aunt Kolab in the kitchen she doesn't come out and tell her aunt that she feels weighted down by what she does to help the family because she doesn't want to hurt her feelings.,0
18909,7,"Rose is a very hard-working young woman. As her aunt had asked her, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Poor Rose has had to work four-hour shifts on top of going to school in order to support her brother through college so that, in return, he can work and support Rose and her sister come time for them to go to college.",2
18910,7,they both dont understand what rose  is trying to say,0
18911,7,"stressed- In the 14th paragraph, it says 'She felt too young for so much responsibility', as she cupped her hands together thinking about her life situation.",0
18912,7,"One trait that you could give Rose is that she a hardworker, because when she came to the essay and she didn't have anything to write about. She didn't give up or put it off and not do the essay. She continued to try to find a topic to write about.",2
18913,7,"Rosa is very motherly. When Anna walks in the room Rosa's first response is to ask, 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' This shows how she cares for her and her family.",2
18914,7,"After reading the text, Anna is presented as being tied down, or feeling suffocated. She shows this throughout, but she shows it when she wonders to herself when she would squeeze that essay in(paragraph 3 sentence 1).",0
18915,7,she has too many emotions,0
18916,7,One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Aunt Kolab is that she is hardworking. She is so hardworking that Aunt Kolab notices it. Aunt Kolab says during their converstion that maybe they can find a way that is better for Rose. One that will take so much stress off of her. This shows that she must work hard for the family to keep it running. It shows that Rose is very hardworking.,1
18917,7,"Rose's trait displayed in the story is that she is a very hard worker especially for her family.  When she talks about her day is begins with 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift, then staight home to help Aunt Kelob prepare a quick supper.",1
18918,7,Rose is caring in the way that she does not want to trouble others with her own conflicts.  This is shown when Rose doesn't answer Aunt Kolab when she says Rose feels weighed down by trying help her family.,1
18919,7,"That she is responsible, because she helps her sister Anna with her bad dream, even though she didn't appreciate it.",1
18920,7,Rose has a trait of protectiveness. This is shown through her conversation with Anna when she hides her emotions from Anna. This is an example of protectiveness because she is doing what is best for her by not showing that she is scared as well. This will give Anna a sense of comfort to think that someone is in control. Another example is when Anna first walks in and the first thing Rose does is ask if she is ok.,2
18921,7,Rose is a very kind person.  She asks how her sister feels and goes to her room to check on her.,2
18922,7,Rose is perseverent. She doesn't give up. She works a four-hour shift after school and has to do homework too. She knows that she has her families fate in her hands. She knows that she can't give up.,1
18923,7,AN THE ATHOUR IS RIGHT MONEY DOESNT BUY HAPPYNEST,0
18924,7,She is extremely caring of others and does all she can for other people.. She also always puts herself last before others.,1
18925,7,"Rose has a trait that makes her seem to herself as helpless.  This is a good trait because you can do more work when you have something that needs done although you do not know why.  You feel helpless and so you do something that needs done without you really even knowing you did it.  Rose is talking to Ana at the time that this trait exposes itself.  It says, She tried a laugh taht sounded fake even to her.  This is trying to get her sister to no feel so bad about Papa leaving to go  to Los Angeles.  She is also trying to get her to know that it is their responsibility to support Paul through college.",0
18926,7,Rose is very stressed because of this essay. She just needed to take her mind off of the essay. In the end she wasn't thinking about the essay and her Aunt helped her firgure out  title by not really even helping her.,0
18927,7,Rose is very determind but she is also being wighed down by other things like the essay she is doing to help her family. She is very determind to get the essay done and help her family and her brother.,2
18928,7,"Even though it doesn't say in the story, but you can kind of get a hint that Rose is older than Anna, but also younger than Paul. Paul is away, so Rose has to step in and be the mature one and watch after her little sister. She is mature, because in the conversation with Anna talking about her father, Rose is trying to soothe Anna's thoughts about missing her dad.",1
18929,7,"If I had to use one trait to describe Rose from this story, I would say she is overwhelmed. In this story, I could tell by her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab that she felt like she had too much resting on her shoulders. For example, when Aunt Kolab says '... This must be difficult for you. Yes?' and Rose nods.",0
18930,7,Well Rose is upset because of her essay and Anna tries to confort her like any sister would and Rose is angry.,0
18931,7,"Rose has forgotten how to care for others, by only looking towards the future and forgetting the present. From being over worked in the persuit of raising money for her brother she has lost sight of her sister and how to care for her. Here in this passage she directly ignores her sister, ' 'I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.' 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said' (Paragraph 7 Line 1).",0
18932,7,Rose is hopeful that since her aunt sees it her way that her life will get better.,1
18933,7,"Her distress defines her as a character.  She is worried about what will happen and is feeling great pressure from her family to succeed and to contribute to the family.  I drew this from her Aunt's response to the dream, when she said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help the family?', a question  she did not answer because the truth would hurt her aunt.",0
18934,7,"rose tried to anna can understand the real problem with their parents and she is trying to do her best to have a good family by her side but anna just dont get the situation. for example rose told anna that her parents need to work more and that they have to appreciate the opportunity that they are having in their job and anna just dont get that, thats a good opportunity for her family.",0
18935,7,Rose can be described by being stressed. In the story it state that her brain became exhausted and is always busy moving from one activity to another.,0
18936,7,I feel she is respectful because she listens patiently while the other person is speaking.,0
18937,7,"Rose seems to always act like the mother in the house when her mother works late.  She goes to school, has a job, cooks supper for the family, then she does homework.",0
18938,7,"In the passage Rose is feeling weighed down by her family because she has to work and go to school just to be able for her family to live a some what normal life. In her conversation with Anna, Anna has a different view of the story because she is younger and doesnt have to work she doesnt see the unjust position that her older sister and he mother are in. She doesnt understand why their father had to leave for a better paying job. Anna has a lot of resentment towards her family but she is continually trying to surpress her feelings. In Anna and Rose's conversation 'Anna glared at Rose. 'Money isn't everything' 'Only if you already have everything,' Rose said. She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This reveals that even though Rose loves her family she resents that she has to help send her brother to school, but she is putting on a brave face for her little sister and saying that even though they have to work hard it will all get better soon.",0
18939,7,"Rose is composed. She is breaking under the weight of her essay, her job, and all the stress in her life, yet when Anna comes in to talk about her nightmare, Rose is calm and collected. 'I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.' Anna is distracting Rose from spending much needed time on her essay with a mundane topic, but Rose still speaks gently to her with the compassion of a loving sister.",1
18940,7,She is a very respectful person because Rose didnt answer her Aunt Kolabs question because it would hurt her aunt since she feels so weighed down by helping out her family.,2
18941,7,One trait that can describe Rose is caring. One detail from the story would be when she was thinking about the fate of two lives resting in Paul's hands and one resting in her hands.,1
18942,7,that she is caring for her sister cause she is upset. rose said as gently as she could,1
18943,7,She feels that everything will get better and her sister should appericate what she has. It says 'When Pual finishes college he'll pay for us to go to college.,0
18944,7,"She is a worried person. She thinks that she does not want to have the responsibility that Paul had and she thinks that if she tells her aunt, her aunt will be upset.",0
18945,7,"One trait that can describe Rose is that she, though feels extremely weighed down by her many responsibilites, always puts the wellness of her family as a whole before her own well being.  This is shown during her conversation with her sister, Anna.  Anna is complaining about their father being gone but Rose argues that their father needed the far away job to help pay for Paul's, their older brother, college education so that when he gets a job he will help to pay for their education.",0
18946,7,"Rose is a hard worker who works to exhaustion, as can be seen when she says, 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' to Anna.",2
18947,7,"While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, one trait that I saw was that her Aunt was very supportive. Her Aunt gave Rose a different point of view of the sitution by her saying they can find a way to do things different.",0
18948,7,"Rose feels upset because her brother is schooling and she has to take care of everyone.  She thinks that after Paul finishes college, he will get a great job and pay for the two girls tuitions.",0
18949,7,"Rose is caring, because ' If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'",2
18950,7,She worries too much. Ex. when she tells her aunt about the dream.,0
18951,7,that aunt kolab would help out rose with her problems and strees she has when aunt kolab said she wouls sew for the ladies or sell things for the communtiy to help out rose,0
18952,7,One trait of Rose is that she is a very generous person. She spends all her time working so she can earn money to help her family.,0
18953,7,THAT SHE WAS A PERSON WHO DIDNT WANT TO LISTEN TO ANYBODY.,0
18954,7,"Rose wishes to be successful; an overachiever with life and education. While talking to her sister, Rose says that her father went off for the better-- to make more money. Anna, Roses's sister, is furious and explains that money is not everything in life.Rose disagrees and says that they have to help Paul get through college, then herself, and Anna. She feels like she has to put the weight on her shoulders to benefit others. She overachieves, or tries to, throughout the beginning of the story.",0
18955,7,"She tells her aunt everything and is very trustworthy, but she feels guilty about what happened to her brother.  She had the bad dream about her brother but made herself feel better by talking to her aunt.",0
18956,7,"Rose tries to do so much for everyone that she is to exhausted to do things she issupposed to do, (school work.) As Rose says, 'EvenifIdowin,' she thought, 'I won't get to travel to Sacramento to receive the prize.'",0
18957,7,"Rose is respectful to her elders, she does not want to be honest as to not offend her family. In paragraph 19, Rose didnt answer because it said she would hurt her aunt.",0
18958,7,"Rose is scared, and feels that she has to much responsebilty for her age, in the story she has a dream of Paul weighing down on her, which would simbolize the the preasure she feels from having to do as much as she does.",0
18959,7,Rose feels stressed. You can tell this by the way she is actin when her sister is trying to talk to her. Anna is trying to tell Rose something and Rose says that she sounds just like Mama in an angry tone.,0
18960,7,Rose is an easy going person but she is also very stressed out because of all of the help that she is doing for the family so her brother can finish college. Rose has to work right after school and has no time for her school work.,1
18961,7,"Rose always tried to do what was best for her family.  It was not until her dream about Paul's body drowning her that she realized how stressed she really was. As soon as her aunt suggested taking some of the weight off of Rose and doing more to help, Rose instantly felt a little bit more relaxed, and grateful towards her aunt.",2
18962,7,rose sees others points threw their eyes not just hers.it says in the story i realize thar you are seeing the situation throught through other eyes.,0
18963,7,"Rose is encouraging. She was having a very rough day when Anna walked into the kitchen. Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' Despite her feelings, she tried to encourage Anna and keep their conversation postive.",2
18964,7,"'Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't.'She seems undecided, but she's willing to take things as they come. She has a half positive outlook on things.",2
18965,7,"Rose is caring because she is working herself until she is exhausted because she is trying to help out her family, by helping pay for her older brother's college.",1
18966,7,"One trait that can describe Rose is that she is caring of her family. Rose fits in school, work, and helping her aunt cook dinner each day, even though she feels she has too much to handle. She continues to do these things because she feels it is her responsibility to help her family. In the conversation with her Aunt Kolab, she admitted that she felt weighed down by everything she was doing. Her aunt then offered to sell treats from Cambodia to lessen Rose's responsibility, leaving Rose feeling lighter.",1
18967,7,I think that Rose is resentful of the fact that her family is not with her. That Paul needs the money their father is making while in Los Angeles that makes him have to be so far away from the rest of the family. Also that she feels that she has to help to bring Paul into college.,0
18968,7,Rose is very jealous of her brother Paul.,0
18969,7,"Rose is very considerate of others and puts others before herself. This was shown when she talked to both Anna and Aunt Kolab. When she talked to Aunt Kolab she realized that everything she was doing for Paul and for the family was worth it. She shows this when she says, 'Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing.'",1
18970,7,"She is a hard worker. She goes to school, then straight to work, then home to cook, and finally does her homework which just so happens to be a 3000 word essay.",1
18971,7,She is very stressed by the wieght she has on her shoulders.,0
18972,7,Rose is hard-working because she weighs herself down with responsibilities for the purpose of supporting her family.,1
18973,7,Rose is a type of person that doesn't give up eaisly and fights untill she gets it all worked out. When her and her sister were fighting she kept arguing untill they came to a conclusion and they both felt they had won and walked away.,0
18974,7,"In the story Rose is very mature. She is trying to succeed in school, help out around the house, and blance a job. Although her situation isn't ideal, she performs the same tasks everyday. I noticed her maturity when her Aunt asked is she felt weighed down by the family. Rose didn't reply because she didn't want to hurt her Aunt. This shows me that she not only understands the feeling of others, but also understand her families situation. At her age, this shows maturity.",0
18975,7,"Rose is very determined. She does everything she can to help pay for her brother's college, even though she is exhausted and stressed. In the conversation between Rose and Anna in paragraph 11, Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' This statement shows that Rose knows how important it is for her and her sister to stick through the hard times to get the money for her brother.",2
18976,7,"One trait that can describe Rosa is talented. Talented descrides her dream and yet the fact that she came up with a story about her dream. It was also creative, she didn't just pick some idea and settle with it, she put time and effort.",0
18977,7,"One of the traits that Rose has is careing. During the conversation with Anna, Rose is asking her whats wrong and if she feels okay. She cares about her and her family. One other example would be when she is talkin to Aunt Kolab she doesnt want to tell her that its too much work for her to handle. She doesnt want to upset them, because she cares about how they feel.",2
18978,7,"Rose is a dedicated person. While she is talking to Aunt Kolab, she figures out what topic she is going to write her essay about, which shows her dedication to getting her work done. Rose is also proved to be dedicated by working on her essay until she falls asleep and keeps up with school and a job.",1
18979,7,"Rose cares about how other people will feel if she really tells them how she feels. For example when Aunt Kolab asks Rose, 'if she feels wieghed down by what she is doing for her family'. Rose's response is,' if i told the truth, i would hurt my aunt and she might tell mother.",2
18980,7,Rose felt more hopeful after talking to her aunt. The story tells us that her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.,2
18981,7,Rose is very selfish.,0
18982,7,Rose is a strong individual because she hasn't seen her dad in four months.Plus she has to go to school then right after school she goes to work and after she gets off of work she has to do homework .,0
18983,7,"Unsure is a trait i would use to describe Rose. One example is how she if fretting andunsure about the essay contest coming up, and she's also unsure about her brother is what her dream showed.",0
18984,7,'I hate how late she has to work',0
18985,7,"In the story, Aunt Kolab asked if Rose felt like the family is wieghing her down. Even though it was true, she decided not to answer. This makes me assume that Rose is a very helpful and respectful person.",1
18986,7,Rose is a person that tried and do watever she can to help out her family. Like she works at a restuarant to help around the house. Rose's mother always have to work late.,0
18987,7,"One trait attributed to Rose is a sense of hopelessness. In the dream, she puictures her self collapsing under the weight of her responsibilities, and under her brother's.",0
18988,7,She is very mature and you can tell because she can fell the stress from Paul and knows her responsibilities.,0
18989,7,She has always been so busy.,0
18990,7,"She has faith in everything she does, and she cares about her sister. I believe its because she tells her sister that everything will work out and that they will go to college like their brother.",2
18991,7,Rose hides how she really feels to both of the characters. This is one trait that she has and she shows it by not saying what she really whats too.,0
18992,7,One character trait that I can identify about Rose is that she is not very outspoken due to her conversation with Aunt Kolab. She seemed like she was scared to tell her aunt how she relly felt because she was afraid of hurting her aunt's and her mothers feelings.,0
18993,7,Rose is faithful. She is faithful because she doesn't want to hurt anyone in her family. She does what she is asked because she knows its the right thing to do. In the story the aunt askes 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help thins family?'  and Rose didn't answer because the truth would hurt her aunt and she doesn't want to hurt anyone. Rose is a good person.,0
18994,7,"Rose acts like she is resentful to her family. When she lists all the struggles she went through with her normal day, it sounds like she resents having to do what seems like all the work. She goes to school, then to work at a restraunt, then she had to go home and work more to prepare dinner.",0
18995,7,"One trait that can describe Rose is a presistance. Her school day was very long. After school, she went to work and did a long shift, then came home and made supper, and now she was trying to make a three-thounsand word essay. That takes someone who is a hard worker and who is persistant.",1
18996,7,"Rose is very understanding in her attempt to calm Anna down. This trait is expressed by the way she trys to explain why Papa is gone. For example when Anna started to bring up the fact that Papa has bein gone for a while, Rose trys to help by saying, 'Its only been four months.'",1
18997,7,Rose is a heard worker like her dad. Her dad took a job in Los Angels. He doesnt get to see his family much,1
18998,7,"In the story Rose seems to be overworked. 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was tim to do homework.'",0
18999,7,"Rose is obviously very confused, she has a great burden to carry, but is confused by what other people think of it.",0
19000,7,"Rose is selfless. When Anna came into the kitchen to talk to her after her nightmare, she started talking about how she misses Papa and she wishes Mama didn't have to work such late hours. Anna, I'm sure, felt the same way, but she hid her feelings because she had to make Anna feel better. She had to put her little sister before herself.",2
19001,7,rose respects and cares about how other people might thin before she speaks. in the story she didnt want to tell her aunt something because she didnt want to hurt her feelings.,2
19002,7,Rose was a very hard working girl. She felt really lonely because her dad had just left and her mother worked most of the day. She said she felt too young for so much responsibility.,1
19003,7,"Detuermined,eshe said that they had to do their part to help paul get thru college then he will get a good job and he'll pay for them to go to college.",2
19004,7,"Rose is always tired or busy, because when Rose was talking to Anna, Rose said that she fell asleep or she could not get the essay done.",0
19005,7,One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with her sister Anna would be she sounds like she wants to be in charge of her sister Anna. Rose acts like a mother figure to Anna. One example from the passage would be when Anna rolled her eyes and shoved the chair away from the table and said 'You sound just like mama'.,0
19006,7,Rose doesn't think she is all to great.  In the beginning she was having trouble writing an essay.  She then tells her sister how she fell asleep while writing it and thinks money is everything.  Then later on she tells her Aunt Kolab of her dream and how much pressure is on her.  Rose thinks she is the underdog in the family.,0
19007,7,"A trait to describe Rose would be stressed. Aunt Kolab said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. Rose didn't answer because if she told the truth, it would hurt her aunt.",0
19008,7,Rose is mature. We know this because when she talked to Aunt Kolab she does not want to hurt her Aunt and therefore does not answer the question about if she feels weighed down.,1
19009,7,"Based on Rose's conversations with her Aunt and her sister, Rose is very mature from the situation she has already been put in. When Rose comes in the kitchen to find her Aunt she confesses that it is difficult.",0
19010,7,"She is a kind person but, she is weighted down with all that is happening to her and her family.     She felt too young for so much responsibility.",1
19011,7,"She is very responsible. She works at a restaurant, and is a full time school student.  She took care of her little sister when she woke up from a bad dream.",1
19012,7,Rose has a charateristic of being very worrisome. In the conversation with her aunt she thinks to herself if her life will get easier or not.,0
19013,7,"One trait, is when Rose said 'as gently as she could'. One detail is when she woke up and came downstairs and her aunt said, ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?', and Anna didn't reply.",0
19014,7,"One trait that could be used to describe her would be, strong. Strength seems to fit her based on what she is trying to do for her family and trying to get a better education as well.",1
19015,7,"Rose is generous. She doesn't tell about how she really feels because she's concerned about everyone else. It is shown in paragraph 18 Aunt Kolab says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing for this family?'. Then in paragraph 19 when the narrator states, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'. This shows that Rose is generous and concerned of the well-being of others.",2
19016,7,"Rose is very quiet. When she was talking to Aunt Kolab, she just kept nodding. When she was talking to Anna, she kept changing the subject and suppressing how she really felt about the situation.",0
19017,7,"She is stressed, and seems to be having trouble managing everything that needs to be done, but she is willing to do it to help out her family. In her converstation with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish College. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'

All of that can cause a lot of stress which is why she was sleepy and day dreaming and which is also why she had that dream, because drems do relate to what you'r feeling.

19278,7,"She trys to help other people out however she can, she shows this because she is helping paul finish college.",2

19284,7,One trait that can describe Anna would be motivation.  Anna has a lot of motivation to help her family.  She doesn't want to see her family struggle so she does everything she can to help out like earning money by working at a restaurant.  A detail form the story that supports my answer would be when she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.',2
19285,7,"I believe Rose is very grateful about things in her life. Even though she feels stressed and pressured to make it easier for everyone else she doesn't tell her Aunt Kolab. She knows it's kind of her job to be that way. It definately shows when her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down and it says 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.",1
19286,7,She was scared to tell her ant the truth so she asked her a question instead of just coming out with what she needed to say. So I can say that she is lonesome or does not trust any one with her feelings. it shows this in paragragh 19,0

19292,7,"According to the text one trait of Anna's would be that she really cares about her family. It goes to show in the text the conversation between Rose and Aunt Kolab.

19316,7,"Rose can be described as conservative in the stroy. This is shown through the fact that she is very conservative in her thoughts about the family difficulties involving money. By being conservative with her thoughts, she proves that the family is more important to her than her own personal well being.

She always said to her sister, Anna, He'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' It didn't sound convincing to Anna and you know that because it states in the reading that she's already heard that from their mother. Rose just trys to be optimistic.
