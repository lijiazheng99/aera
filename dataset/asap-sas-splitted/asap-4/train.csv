8343,4,1,1,Invasive means you cannot avoid it. So saying that snakes or reptiles could be invasive could be a bad thing. A USGS map showed potential python habitat stretching from California to Delaware and including much of the south. Since the pythons are sustainable on those parts they could keep on multiplying and create more.
8344,4,2,1,"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that when people think something is invasive, it shouldn't belong.

8360,4,1,1,"Invasive means to take control over everything.The article points out that pythons can live and adopt themselves to different habitats which means that they are able to ""invade"" several locations of region and might be away for some people."
8361,4,2,2,"The generalist that are spread accidentally have seen to be ""invasive"" to that environment. Because the natural predators are taken away from the generalists, they are allowed to flourish in the new surroundings. The ""aliens"" will then disrupt the biodiversity if it is not held under control. Invasive species may become extinct of the introduced generalists."
8363,4,0,0,"invasive  is very significant to the rest of the article because it describes reptiles as how people see them.

8364,4,1,1,"An invasive species is one that can threat or make damage on a native species. What the article is trying to say is that, snakes should be introduced into the wild. For example a python swallowed a native alligater. Invasive species are also huge threats to biodiversity."
8367,4,1,2,"When the article mentions invasive, it means a species is dominating the ecosystem it inhabits. Since pythons are generalists predators, they can take down almost any species within its ecosystem, allowing them to thrive and take over the whole ecosystem."
8368,4,1,1,The significance of the word ''invasive'' that snake coming from every where and coming to the United States all that keep spreading.
8369,4,1,1,"Invasive means when something encroches another living for instance, the pythons eating the endangered species or even trying to eat a alligator. Pythons are becoming invasive by going into new territories. The author is trying to stop the pythons from being invasive."
8370,4,1,1,"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article tells the reader how harmful these species are to biodiversity. These snakes are already harming endangered species and are not only a harm to other animals but to humans as well."

Biologists, however say that since these species are not kept in balance by natural predators, they are ""invasive"" and are ""major threats to biodiversity""."
9202,4,0,0,"The word ""invasive"" is significant because it is being used to describe python species. It is being used to describe pythons because they are pulled out of their habitat to become pets."
9204,4,0,0,The significance of invasive in the article is that they are calling the new types of pets invasive. This is because these pets are wild animals & shouldn't be kept in a cage.

9244,4,1,0,To my knowledge invasive sort of means threat. The significance of this word to the rest of the article is most people would consider the animals sold invasive and or a threat.

9249,4,2,2,"The significance of the word invasive in the article is that it describes a dangerous situation that is occuring in the US.

9259,4,1,1,"The word invasive relates to this article in a way, because snakes are migrating into our country.

It is left to the reader to decide if the animals are ""invasive"""
9264,4,1,1,"The significance of the word ''invasive'' means something has been found a place where it wasn't found before. & pythons/snakes were seen places that they weren't seen before. In paragraph 11''what's certain is that by 2002, pythons were seen in multiple locations in the remote regions of the Everglades.''"
9265,4,1,1,"The word invasive means your coming into someones territory. In paragraph 12 we see snakes have gone invasive and are popping up in many places of the world. In this case by the snakes being invasive of other animals we are being invasive of other animals, we are now starting to see animal extinctions happen."
9266,4,0,0,"The word ""invasive"" is the base of the article. Some people, like RobRoy MacInnes, consider the word rude. While Skip Snow thinks it's the correct word to describe these animals."
9267,4,1,1,Invasive to me means taking over. I believe it means this because reptiles are becoming more common pets all over the world. It seems they're spreading around rapidly.
9268,4,1,1,The significance of the word invasive means invading like its not sapose to be here. Its a more harsh word than introduced. its like their trying to say the reptiles are taking over and the reptile population is booming.
9270,4,2,2,"These invasive species are considered invasive because they weren't supposed to originally be here. This causes an unbalance in the ecosystem. As the article states in paragraph 11, the snakes have imperiled 5 endangered species in the Florida keys. Once they went native, they didn't go back. Causing tennoil in balanced environments it makes sense they've been dubbed ""invasive""."
9271,4,1,1,"Invasive means intruding or tespassing. If you are invasive, you are unwanted. The snakes are called invasive species in this article because some feel they are unwanted, like the people of Florida.

9273,4,1,0,"I think the significance of the word "" invasive"" is ""passing judgement"". In the article says for a pythons its a good introduction because ""However invasive species unchecked by natural predators, are major threat to biodiversity for example a pythons, a crocodile, snakes, and other lethal species."

9283,4,1,1,"Invasive species are animals that ""unchecked by predators, are major threats to biodiversity"", (Achenbach). It is significant to the rest of the article because the author is exploring the validity of these species being harmful to the environment and the potential dangers they present."
9285,4,2,2,"The word invaisive is significant to this article. This article talks about how pythons & other generalized species can live in countries with the same climate as their homeland. But, when these animals move to a new country they invade the enviorment of the animals that are living there. Many bad events can occur because the ecosystem in that area is disrupted by the invaision of the new organism."
9286,4,1,1,Invasive is certainly a significant need in the article. This is because it whole how python have entered the wild by being introduced or invading it then the rest of the article talks about whether as not this is a good thing for the everglades.
9288,4,1,1,Invasive is like pythons naturally living in the Everglades hey shouldn't be their and are not natural to he habitat and are less invading species.
9289,4,1,1,"The significance of the word invase is important. Mac Innes explains how the term invasive is unfair. He says, ""They're introduced, I think invasive is passing judgement.""

Many species are not intrasive, so when it comes to pythons the main idea of the idea of the story; Intrasive is a definition to there habit. Other animals are not like them making the word so much more significant."
9292,4,1,1,"The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is huge. It means that certain animals don't belong in certain places.

9304,4,1,1,"The word invasive is used in the article one man's pet, another's invasive species.

9312,4,1,1,The significance of the word invasive is obsecured. People say its unfair to use on the pythons because the python is such a snake in Florida according to (paragraph 7). One person think that its a wonderful introduction. But really invasive species are major threats to the biodiversity and news moved around the world so fast according to paragraph 9.
9313,4,1,1,"Invasive is implying that they are taking over and destroying what was there before. This word is significant because it shows that instead of the animals just living there, they are driving th old species out as well."
9315,4,0,0,"The term ""invasive"" is crucial to this article because it's harsh meaning resembles the way people think of reptiles. Reptiles, such as lizards and snakes, are generally treated badly.

I think that invasive is passing judgement.'' And ''invasive'' is significant throughout the article because it talks about the python and almost how destructive it can be, but also it can be a good household pet."
9319,4,2,2,"Invasive species refer to animals/species that was introduced to an area it did originally live in.

This is because they are not used to having pythons there."
9320,4,0,0,The word invasive has a lot of significance because Mac Innes believes the term is unfair and is passing judgement and the whole article is based on his studies.

9324,4,1,1,I believe the significance of the word ''invasive'' to the rest of the article is to be completely out  of control. The reason why I believe this is because in the article MacInnes got offended and stated ''even the term invasive species'' is unfair. ''Reading that told me that it was something harsh enough to take offense to.
9325,4,1,1,"The word invasive means in this case that the animals change rapidly. This is a threat to biodiversity, because they cant controll how fast its changing."
9326,4,1,1,I believe that describing these animals as invasive is very fitting their characteristics. These animals have invaded the everglades and its surrounding areas when there are repponts of the animals under the hood of a tourists col then the animal is definitly invasive.
9327,4,0,0,"Invasive are species like snake. In the article, it says that ""Even the term"". Invasive species"" is unfair. ""They're introduced,' that invasive is passing judgment."

9334,4,0,0,The word invasive is significant to the rest of the article because the article is talking about pythons who are invasive species and explaining how they are becoming less and less invasive as years go by because now there are more being seen in various other locations around the world.
9335,4,0,0,Invasive was constantly used through out the article.

9348,4,0,0,Invasive in this article means that people may be invaded the reptiles space and something happened.
9349,4,1,1,"Invasive in implied as a bad thing, making the cobras seem to invade the U.S. The pythons in the U.S were from Asia so the species ""invaded"" the U.S because it was not indiginous. Also, people who don't like the world to change fast would call them invasive as it is a strong word."

9356,4,0,0,"There is a significance to the word ""invasive"". MacInnes thinks the word invasive is unfair, ""they're introduced, I believe it is significant because there are double the amount of people now that have reptiles as pets and that invasive is a passing judgement."
9357,4,2,1,The word invasive means to invade area and take over. This word is significant because the story says ''invasive species are major threats to bio diversity.''
