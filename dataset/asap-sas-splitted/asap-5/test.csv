13321,5,the mRNA leaves the nucleus and takes the information it has to the tRNA which then translates the information to tell the cell what codon it needs to bring to complete the chain. Once that is done the tRNA sends the chain to be assembled. Once it is assembled the left over material is sent out of the cell to be desposed of.,1

13338,5,"The messenger RNA leaves the nucleus and brings the DNA to the cytoplasm. The DNA ladder unzips and the nucleotides are trying to find their matches. This is called transcription. RNA processing then occurs and the genetic code is given to the nucleus. Translation happenes after the genetic code reaches the nucleus. During translation, the codons find their anti-codons in pairs of 3 to start making amino acids. After 20 amino acids, there will be a stop codon indicating the process to stop.",1
13339,5,"The mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then with the coiled DNA sequence, it matches up the corresponding amino acids. Then it goes to the ribosome and drops off the amino acids that match.
