The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.

12650,5,1,1,"After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to the ribosomes to leave the cell. Once the ribosomes leave the cell through the cell membrane that is dissappearing, it goes and attaches itself to the codon strand. Once at the strand, it copies the data that will then be sent to get the anticodon strand to match up and make a protein."
12653,5,0,0,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, tRNA transfers the proteins to the ER. After this rRNA takes it from the ribosome and then the protein is sent it off into the cell."
12657,5,0,0,The mRNA goes to the mitochondrion and tells the transfer rna what to do. The tRNA then goes and gets what is needed and brings it to the cell. The rRNA finishes off the RNA sequence with the missing piece(s) that the tRNA brought.
12666,5,0,0,mRNA leaves the nucleus travels into the gogi body out the anus into the enviroment
12680,5,2,2,"1.  The DNA unzips and is copied to create mRNA which can then leave the nucleus because it is single stranded.2. After leaving the Nucleus, the mRNA travels to the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome.3. The Ribosome then attaches tRNA to the corresponding nucleotide sequences. The tRNA has amino acids attached to the end of it.4. After a second tRNA is attached, the aminoacids form a phosphate bond with eachother and the first tRNA is ejected to recieve another Amino acids. This step repeats until the protein is complete, the stop codon is reached, and a the last amino acid breaks from the last tRNA"
12681,5,1,1,whem rna becomes mrna it sends out messages to other rnas and then the mrna attatches to a ribison to become rran and the n when the rrna matches up with rrna it transfers into an tran to exchange its geneitc information
12687,5,1,1,the mrna goes to the ribosomes and the trna tranlates the mrnas mesage so the ribosomes can make protiens from the blueprints it get from the mrna
12689,5,0,0,the first step is it reads the RNA.Then it transcripe it and groups codon.The third step is translate the new RNA. Then last it is changed and the RNA is ready to go.
12690,5,0,0,mRNA tells the mitochondria to use sugars and make food enzymes along with oxygen.
12699,5,1,1,"The mRNA must bond with a tRNA first and then get the tRNA anticodon to match up with the codon on mRNA.  This means AGC will have to be pair with UCG.  Then after they break off the tRNA breaks off from the mRNA and goes to the ribsomes for them to make the proteins from the animo acids. Basically it is Transcription, Translocation, and then transferring the proteins to the ribsomes to make the protein. To make the protein the ribsomes must match them in that certain order, which with a new RNA molecule, rRNA, and recieve the information from the tRNA and make the protein with chemicals."
12705,5,0,0,"The mRNA gives its information to the next RNA, rRNA which then will pass the information to tRNA while with tRNA the RNA will transcribe the RNA and break it down and anylze it, it will then pass it to the gRNA which is the last step in protein synthesis."
12710,5,0,0,umm.mRNA leaves the nuclues.dna returns to nucleus.ribosomes appear.they make the proteins.
12711,5,0,0,"Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are messaging RNA, ribosomal RNA, transfering RNA, and protein production.mRNA attaches to a section of a chromosome, and then it copies the amino acid code that makes up the chromosome. Next, the mRNA messages the rRNA to copy this section of the chromosome into an anticodon which is an exact reflection of the original code. The rRNA has the tRNA transfer this code into a set code for a new protein. Finally, protein production occurs where the protein is synthesized to match the original code for the DNA."
12714,5,0,0,"then you go to pRNA, then you go to oRNA, then you enter tRNA, then gRNA, then you stop."
12718,5,0,0,mRNA goes out the cell goes and bonds to an amino acids form strings of proteins that are held together by peptide bonds.
12719,5,0,0,"It use prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. In prophase the chromosomes begin to develop chromatids. They are then attatched to the centromere. The next stage is metaphase. The nucleus begins to dissapear. The chromosomes finish their attatchment and line up at the center. The next stage is anaphase where the centromere splits and each centromere goes to a pole. In telophase the cell then slpits in half to form two cells."
12735,5,1,1,1. The mRNA bind to the tRNA2. The anticodons attach to the codons3. A polypeptide chain is formed4. Proteins are made

12755,5,1,1,After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it takes the directions it got from the nucleas to the ribosomes. Then enzymes unzip the DNA so it can be copied. Then the DNA that was made is trasfered by tRNA and he transferes it to RNA so that rRNA can put together the nucleotide sequence to make the protiens.
12758,5,0,0,the code has to change.
