1801,1,In the procedure they did not tell the sample's that they was doing to be testing. Also didn't tell us what mass was when they started and when they was finish what was the mass. Last they didn't tell us that they need to find the difference in mass.,1
1802,1,"In order to correct the errors in this experiment, some few things need to be changed. Firstly, the procedure never mentions recording your data; this needs to be part of the procedure. Secondly, the procedure states, ""determine the mass."" It is not explained how to do so and what to use. Thirdly, the procedure never tells what samples are or what to label them as in the experiment.

1933,1,In the procedure number I doesn't explain what four different samples to use. Another thing the procedure could have said was to list what materials to use. After reading this procedure I would be able to replicate this experiment. Not knowing how much vinegar to pour in might mass up this experiment.,2

Finally, at the end of the procedure, it should tell you to record your data and find the difference in the masses.",3
1974,1,Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be to add more materials to the experiment. Adding different kinds of pack could influence other materials in the experiment. Another peice of information to be considered would be to increase the time the materials are soaked in the vinegar.

1980,1,"To replicate a better experiment, the first thing you would want to add is how much vinegar is poured in each container. If one container has more than the other, more will erode the material quicker giving inaccurate results. Another factor they may want to change to the same weight and size of the material once again isn't going to give you good results.

The mass of each were marble 4.8, limestone 10.4, wood 11.6 and plastic 7.2. When we put them in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minutes we saw that the mass of the marble went down to 9.4, limestone 9.1, wood 11.2, and plastic 7.1.

2155,1,"First, the procedure needs is specific which materials are being used as sample. In the procedure, there was and mention of the samples being marbles of any kind. Also, the procedure doesn't a tempt to control the amount of vinegar in each container. This is necessary to replicate the experiment as different volumes of vineea eased after the estume. The procedure, finally needs to keep the size of the marbles constant. Surface area may be a factor in the experiment.",3
2156,1,"After reading the group procedure, some additional information that should be added is to list what numbers steps that you have to repeat because it a little confusing on what steps to repeat. Another one is to list out the materials, it has no information on what materials are being used only in the data table which was done after the experiment. Next thing they should add is the amount of vinegar,water etc that is need for the experiment for all trials and lastly they should be specific about where to put  thing for example where do you put the materiasl often washing them off.",3
