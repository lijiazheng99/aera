However, the descriptions provided are not accurate or complete. The description of active transport implies the use of transport proteins, but the definition is too broad and does not accurately reflect the fact that active transport requires energy and moves substances against a concentration gradient. The definition of passive transport is also too broad and does not specify that it refers to the movement of substances from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. The descriptions of exocytosis and endocytosis are accurate but lack specificity.  To improve the answer, the student could provide more detailed and accurate definitions of each process and provide examples of molecules that are transported using each mechanism. For example, they could specify that active transport involves the use of ATP and specific transport proteins to move molecules against a concentration gradient, whereas passive transport relies on diffusion and does not require energy.
