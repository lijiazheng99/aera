4066,2,Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B has the largest amount stretched. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental decison is by allowing the weights to hang longer to see if the plastic would stretch more. Another way he could have improved his experiment is by doing a third trials to really be sure that his results are correct.,2,"  Score 2: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. The student correctly identifies that plastic type B has the largest amount of stretch based on the data provided. They suggest two ways to improve the experiment, but only one is needed for a valid response. Therefore, the response describes one way to improve the experiment.",2
4067,2,A. Sample B plastic has the most stretchability. B. One way it to add the original length of the plastic to the chart so you can find the difference of the original and after it stretched. Another way is to show the weight of the weights being put on.,3,"  Score 2: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data (Sample B plastic has the most stretchability, Sample A plastic has the least stretchability, and different polymer plastics have different stretchability) and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results (adding the original length of the plastic to the chart and showing the weight of the weights being put on). However, the response does not include T1 and T2 stretchability values for plastic sample C and incorrectly states that all polymer plastics have different stretchability, which is contradicted by plastic samples A and C having similar stretchability.",2
4068,2,The stretchiest plastic was plastic B in both trials. And the least stretchiest plastic was plastic A in both trials. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by adding a control and using the same length of each plastic.,2,"  Score 2: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. The student correctly identifies the most and least stretchy plastics and supports it with data. They suggest one valid improvement by adding a control and making sure the length of each plastic is the same. However, the student could have provided more details or explanations for their suggestions, and they did not address the issue of sample thickness or suggest additional trials.",2
4069,2,a. Conclusion: type a plastic stretched the most. ^p b. The student have used the same length of plastic for every type and should have did more than one trial.,1,"  Score: 1  The student draws a partial conclusion, stating that type A stretched the most, which is incorrect according to the data provided. The conclusion also does not take into account the stretchability of the other plastics. One improvement is listed but is incomplete and lacks explanation. Hence, the response only partially addresses the prompt and lacks detail and accuracy.",1
4070,2,a) Plastic type A and B stretched after being pulled apart for five minutes. Plastic type C and D either shrank in length or stayed the same.^p b) The student should of added a control by hanging the plastics with no weight. Also the student should specify how much weight is on the clamp.,1,"  Score 1: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. The student correctly states which plastics stretched or did not stretch, but only suggests one improvement to the experimental design. Additionally, the student's suggestion to specify the weight added to the clamp is already provided in the procedure.",1

The student could've used different clamps in his trials, this would've expanded the student possibilities with the plastics. To help with the validity, the student could explain what he did different. For trial T2, for the measures are not the same as T1 except for plastic type D, in both trials the measures were the same.",1,"  Score 2: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data (plastic B was the most stretchable) and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results (using different clamps in trials). However, the second suggestion regarding explaining what was different between T1 and T2 for validity doesn't quite address a specific improvement that could be made to the experimental design.",2
4072,2,The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic B was the strongest. Plastic B was the strongest because in trial one it stretched the most to 22mm. Ther trial two B stretched to 23mm. To improve the experiment design the student could state a length they want the sample plastic to be. In the procedure the student should have stated labels that she/he was measuring in.,2,"  Score 1: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. The student accurately identifies that plastic B stretched the most and draws a valid conclusion. However, they only describe one way the experiment design could be improved and do not clearly explain how their suggestion would improve the validity of the results. Additionally, their suggestion for labeling the measurements is not clear or specific enough to be considered a valid improvement.",1
4073,2,"A conclusion that can be dawn from the students experiment is that plastic B is able to stretch the farthest (T1:22mm, T2:23mm) and plastic A stretched the least (T1:10mm, T2:12mm). The validity of this experiment could have been improved greatly by doing these two things; 1) Making sure that the starting length of the plastics were all the same and 2)determining how much of the plastic will be stretched to the table at the beginning. By doing these two things, you're ensuring controlled variables therefore validating your experiment",3,"  This student answer should receive a score of 2. The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data but only describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. The student mentioned that they could have made sure the starting length of the plastics was the same for all samples, but did not provide a second improvement.",2
4074,2,B. Two ways the students could improve the experiment is to doing it again and again until you get the same results. Another way could to leave the plastics hanging for longer.,1,"  Score 1: The response describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design, but fails to draw a valid conclusion or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the data. The answer doesn't mention anything about which plastic is more stretchable or less stretchable, which is required to draw a valid conclusion from the data. Additionally, the suggested methods for improving the experiment are not specific or feasible, as simply repeating the experiment multiple times without making any changes to the procedure or addressing the issues with the initial design may not yield more accurate or reliable results. A longer testing period may also be problematic, as it could increase the risk of deformity or breakage in the samples due to fatigue or overstress. Therefore, the response does partially address the prompt but lacks accuracy, specificity, and depth necessary for earning higher points.",1
4075,2,"I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable because according to the data plastic B in trial 1 stretched 22mm and trial 2 23mm unlike plastic type A which in T1 stretched 0mm and in trial 2 2mm. One way the students could have improved their experiment would be of saying exactly how much weights to add and keep it the same for all the plastics. Another way they could have improved this experiment would be by having the same length of plastic for all the plastics, also they could have done more trials to improve their experiment.",3,"  The student answer should receive a score of 2. The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data (that plastic type B is the most stretchable) and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design (keeping the weight consistent for all plastics and having the same length of plastic for all the plastics), but the response does not discuss the validity of the results or mention the similarity between the stretching of plastic types A and C.",2
4076,2,"a. Based on the data, the strectchiest polymer plastic of the four is plastic type B, because in the both trials, it stretched the most (22 and 23 mm). ^p b. 1.)

The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the data and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design. However, it fails to describe a second way to improve the experimental design.",2
4077,2,a) The only type of plastic that appears to make no change with the 2 trials is plastic type D. ^p b) They could have improved their design/validity by telling us exactly how much they measured in procedure 1. Another would be they could do a 3rd trial.,1,"  The Student answer should get a score of 1. They draw a valid conclusion based on the data, but their suggestions for improving the experimental design/validity are incomplete and do not explain how their suggested improvements would address the issues. Specifically, their suggestion about measuring in procedure 1 is unclear as the length was already measured in that step. Additionally, simply suggesting a third trial does not address the potential thickness variations or uneven weight distribution mentioned in the prompt.",1
4078,2,"a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable of all the plastic types. Type D was a close second. Plastic type A and C are not very stretchy. ^p b. To improve the validity of the experiment the student could have done 2 things, give the length of the plastics they used and give the amount/type of weights to weigh  the plastic down with the information, the experiment can be duplicated to get similar results.",3,"  The Student answer should get a Score 2 because it draws a valid conclusion from the data and describes one way to improve the experimental design. The answer correctly identifies that plastic type B is the most stretchable and that types A and C are not very stretchy. It also suggests that providing information on the length of plastics and the amount/type of weights used would improve the validity of the experiment. However, it did not suggest a second way to improve the experimental design, as required for a Score 3.",2
4079,2,Thus for our experimentation our data has proved in conclusion that plastic type B and D recivied similiar results as also high strechibility on their first trial. One way the students could have improved the data is by putting the tike in the data chart. Another way being how students could have improved their data is by telling the amount of weights added for stretching.,1,"  Score 1: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data, that plastic type B and D received similar results with high stretchability on their first trial, but fails to describe how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. The two suggested ways to improve the experiment design, putting the time and the amount of weight added, are not relevant to improving the validity of the results. Therefore, the response only partially meets the criteria for a score of 2.",1
4080,2,a. Plastic Type B stretched the farthest in both trials. Type D stretched second farthest in each trial and C and A stretched the third and least farthest respectively. The order of each plastic type's stretchiness remained the same in both trials. ^p b. The student could have done more trials. They also could've used more specific types.,2,"  This student's answer should receive a score of 1.

Additionally, they do not provide any specific details or explanation for their suggested improvements.",1
4081,2,"In conclusion this is what the plastic did in the first try and this is what happened in the second try. The best plastic is plastic B because it hangs longer than the other. ^p To make it better is hang it for 7 minutes. maybe put something else than weight, I think scissors.",0,"  Score 1: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. The student correctly identified that plastic B had the most stretchability, but their suggestion to hang it for 7 minutes and use scissors instead of weights are not improvements that would increase the validity of the results. Additionally, they did not address any potential flaws in the experimental design.",1
4082,2,a) Plastic D is the best type of plastic because it's the most stretchable unlike type A which is the least stretchable.^p b.) Do another trial and add heavier weights.,1,"  The student answer should receive a score of 1. While the answer provides a conclusion based on the data, it only suggests one improvement to the experimental design. Additionally, the conclusion is not fully supported by the data since there is no significant difference in stretchability between plastic types B and D. The answer also does not provide any information about the thickness or starting length of the samples, which could have affected the results.",1
4083,2,Trial 2 was the most stretched plastic because after stretching them a couple of times then they set loose and stretchier than the first time. The most stretchiest was plastic B it has the most stretch than the others. ^p The student could've kept it hanging maybe a little bit longer.,1,"  Score 1: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. The answer correctly identifies that plastic B has the most stretch, but the reasoning is not entirely clear. Additionally, the suggestion to keep the plastic samples hanging longer is not a clear indication of an improvement to validity.",1
4084,2,"3. Based on the data, plastic D held the most weight. Plastic A held the least. Plastic C went down the second time, so maybe it wasnt sturdy enough. Two ways they could improve their experiment is to use different sized plastics. Instead of putting it attached to the table, it could be stretched over a cup. By doing this it will hold more weight, and they will get more acurate answers.",0,"  Score 1: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. The student correctly identifies that Plastic D held the most weight and Plastic A held the least but the rest of the response is not related to the question or data presented. The student does suggest improving the experiment by using different-sized plastics and using a cup instead of attaching the plastic to the table, but these suggestions are not adequately explained and do not address the issues with the original experimental design or the data presented. Additionally, the suggestion to use different-sized plastics would likely introduce more variability into the results, making them less accurate.",1
4085,2,"A) When dealing with different types of plastic to find out their strechability, I found that plastic type A that 1 had the least amount of stretchability, with only 10mm, whereas plastic type B, trial two out measured A, C, and D's stretchability with 25mm!^p B) 1.

The student correctly identifies that plastic D had the most stretchability, but incorrectly states that it stayed the same between trials 1 and 2. The student also fails to mention the relative stretchability of the other plastic samples. The suggestion to perform another trial to confirm results is valid, but only fulfills one of the required improvements. The response does not earn a score of 2 because the conclusion is incomplete and unclear.",1

4473,2,The conclusion of this evestigation is that the plastic types did not stretch much. Type D didn't even phase B. The kould have told us what kind of plastic did they use. And what are you using to measure the plastic types?,0,"  Score 0: The student response provides little to no correct information from the polymer investigation. The response does not draw a valid conclusion based on the data presented, and the two suggestions for improving the experimental design and/or validity of results show a lack of understanding of the investigation. Specific details about the type of plastic and measurement tools were already provided in the procedure. Additionally, the response does not address the comparison of plastic types A and C with the other two types. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for scoring 1 or higher.",0

Therefore, it has the greatest stretchability.^p (b)The experiment could have been improved by ensuring that all the plastics one being clamped with the same amount of weights. It would also be a good idea to use a control, without the use of weights. This way, it would be easier to improve the end results with the control and variable.",1,"  This Student answer should get a score of 2. The response draws a valid conclusion based on the student's data and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. However, the conclusion is not fully comprehensive as it only mentions one plastic type, and there are other reasonable conclusions that could be drawn from the data. Additionally, the second improvement suggested is unclear and contradictory as it mentions using a control group without weights, but the weights were an important part of the procedure.",2

The response correctly draws a conclusion based on the data, stating that the most stretchable plastic is type B. It also describes one way that the student could have improved the experimental design by ensuring the plastics are all the same length. However, there is no mention of a second way to improve the experimental design, so it does not meet the criteria for a score of 3.",2

The student rightly concludes that plastic type B is the most stretchy, and plastic type A is the least. However, they suggest only one way to improve the experimental design - by specifying how long each plastic starts and what the measurement is. The student has missed other ways to improve the experiment, such as ensuring that samples are of the same thickness, performing additional trials, or indicating the number of weights added to each clamp.",2
