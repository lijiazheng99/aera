Each plastic should be the same length. ^P My conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the different types.,"  Score 1: The response fails to provide a valid conclusion that is supported by the student's data (confuses type A with ""held up much stronger""). Additionally, the response only provides one improvement to the experimental design (changing the type of graphing), but this is not relevant to the investigation. The response does not address important issues related to the thickness of the plastics or the number of weights used in the clamp. Therefore, the response does not successfully meet the criteria for a score of 2 or 3.",1

2795,2,2,1,"By looking at the results, one can see that plastic type B and D stretched almost twice as much as the other two types. This shows us that B and D are most likely low density polymers because of their flexibility. A and C however are not as flexible and therefore are high density polymers. The experiment could have been improved by adding another plastic type or running more trials. The weights could have been changed also to test the strength.","  Score 1: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student?? data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. The student draws a valid conclusion by identifying the stretchability differences between the four plastic types. However, the reasons provided for why plastic types B and D are more flexible are not accurate. The student incorrectly identifies density as the reason for differences in flexibility, when in fact the properties of the specific polymer used are what determines flexibility. The student does provide one potential improvement for the experimental design, which is to add another plastic type or run more trials, but does not provide any explanation for why these changes would improve the validity of the results.

Specifically, the answer mentions doing more trials for increased validity, which is a valid improvement suggestion, but it is not explained further as to how more trials would improve the validity.

Although the student draws a conclusion based on the data, the conclusion is incorrect. The student claims that plastic type A is the most durable, when in fact, it is the least stretchable.

However, the description of how the experiment could have been improved is not entirely clear. While ""resting the plastics at the same length"" is mentioned, it is not explained how this would improve the experimental design. Additionally, ""using sam"" is not clear and appears to be incomplete.
