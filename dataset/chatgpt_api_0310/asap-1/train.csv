The student correctly identifies the absence of information such as the amount of vinegar and the type of materials used. However, they only provide two pieces of information instead of the required three for a score of 3. Additionally, the student's response could have been more specific in terms of what other information is needed such as the size and type of container used or the duration of rinsing the samples in distilled water.",2
1651,1,1,1,After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.,"  Score 1: This response only provides one additional piece of information needed to replicate the experiment (how much vinegar to pour) and does not accurately address any of the other needed information. Additionally, the response contains some confusion and errors in language use, such as the usage of ""price marble"" instead of ""place marble"" and using ""made"" instead of labeling the container. Therefore, this answer earns a score of 1.",1
1652,1,1,1,"I would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers. With what am I going to measure the mass of each sample. I think that I would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved (specifically, what am I trying to find out).","  Score 2: The response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment. The student correctly identified the need to know the amount of vinegar used in the containers and how to measure the mass of each sample. However, their mention of needing to know the problem being solved is not a necessary piece of information to replicate the experiment.",2
1653,1,0,0,In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.,"  Score 1: The student describes only one additional piece of information needed to replicate the experiment (how the samples were set up). The other information provided is unclear and doesn't specifically address what is missing from the procedure, such as the amount/type of vinegar used, the size/surface area of the materials tested, and the drying method to be used. The student also adds irrelevant information about the Limestone sample changing the most. Overall, the response lacks clarity and specificity, and does not meet the criteria for a score of 2 or 3.",1
1654,1,2,2,"If you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses.","  Score 1: The response only describes one additional piece of information (how much vinegar to use) that would be needed to replicate the experiment accurately. While the student mentions other important details (types of samples, using the same scale), these are not additional pieces of information as they are already included in the given procedure. Therefore, the student only partially meets the criterion for accuracy and relevance in describing the needed information.",1

(tongs)","  Score 1: The response only describes one additional piece of information (the amount of vinegar) and provides irrelevant information about temperature and tools. While the information about using tongs may be helpful, it is not necessary to accurately replicate the experiment. Overall, the response does not fully address the prompt and lacks important details.",1
1660,1,3,3,"You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.",  Score 1: The response describes only one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment (amount of vinegar). The other piece of information mentioned (dark or sunny place) is not relevant to the acid rain investigation.,1
1663,1,0,0,"I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.","  Score 0: This response does not describe any additional information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment. The response mentions safety goggles and gloves, which are important for safety but not relevant to the replication of the experiment. The response also suggests extending the time and drying the samples for a longer period, but does not provide any reasoning or explanation for why this is necessary or how it would improve the experiment.",0
1664,1,3,3,"In order to replicate the ""acid rain"" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?","  Score: 2 The response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment. The student correctly identifies that the materials to be tested (samples) and the type and size of containers used need to be specified. However, they only partially address the issue of the vinegar type and size of the container, and do not mention the drying method, duration, or any other important details that could affect the results of the experiment.

1665,1,2,2,"In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be.
