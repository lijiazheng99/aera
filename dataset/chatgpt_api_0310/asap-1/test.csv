Without doing that it can effect each substance differently.",1,"  Score 1: This student answer only provides one piece of additional information, which is the amount of vinegar to use in each cup. While this is an important piece of information, it is not enough to replicate the entire experiment accurately. The answer also includes a vague statement about how different amounts of vinegar can affect each substance differently, but does not provide any specific information to support this claim.
