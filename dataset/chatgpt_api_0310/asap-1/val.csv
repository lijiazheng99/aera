Additionally, the student mentions not having information on what ""four different samples"" means and asks for clarification, which is a valid concern. Overall, the answer successfully meets the criteria for a score of 3.",3
1662,1,2,2,"Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment.","  Score: 2 The student's answer includes three pieces of information needed to replicate the experiment: how much vinegar to use, what samples to use, and a control to show that vinegar is what changes the mass. However, the second piece of information ""what are the samples you should use"" is already provided in the procedure, so it is not an additional piece of information needed.",2
1668,1,3,3,"The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.","  Score 2: The response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment (type of sample and amount of vinegar in each container), but no mention of the size of materials is made. The answer is partially correct and relevant, but it is not comprehensive enough to earn a score of 3.",2
1671,1,1,1,"We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p What kind of containers? ^p If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass.","  Score 2: The response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: the type of containers used and whether they are dry or not. While the response does mention the materials to test, it does not provide any additional information about them. Additionally, the response does not mention the amount or type of vinegar used, the length of time each sample was rinsed, or the drying method.",2
