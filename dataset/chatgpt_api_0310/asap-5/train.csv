The prompt mentions that mRNA can also go to the ribosome, which is where protein synthesis actually takes place.   Second, the answer mentions that ribosomes ""move in"" to begin synthesis, which is not quite accurate. Ribosomes are already present in the cytoplasm and can bind to mRNA to initiate synthesis.   Third, the answer correctly describes the binding of complementary anticodons to codons and the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids, but it doesn't explain how this happens. Specifically, it doesn't mention the role of tRNA (transfer RNA) in carrying the correct amino acids to the ribosome.   Finally, the answer correctly describes the role of stop codons in terminating protein synthesis, but it doesn't mention the role of start codons in initiating it.   Overall, this student answer demonstrates some understanding of protein synthesis, but it is not complete or accurate enough to receive full credit.

Then the protein will start to create new proteins, so that the cell can survive, this will help so that the cell will be healthy and can do more tasks. The final step is the mRNA leaves the protein and goes back to the nucleus, so that the mRNA can go to another cell.
