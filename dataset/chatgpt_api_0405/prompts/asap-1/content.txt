[Question]: 
A group of students wrote the following procedure for their investigation.
Procedure:
1.Determine the mass of four different samples.
2.Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical, containers.
3.Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
4.After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
5.Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
6.Determine the mass of each sample.
The students's data are recorded in the table below.
A table contains four columns: Sample, Starting Mass (g), Ending Mass (g), Difference in Mass (g).
The sample for the first row is Marble, with 9.8 Starting Mass, 9.4 Ending Mass and -0.4 for Difference in Mass.
The sample for the second row is Limestone, with 10.4 Starting Mass, 9.1 Ending Mass and -1.3 for Difference in Mass.
The sample for the third row is Wood, with 11.2 Starting Mass, 11.2 Ending Mass and 0.0 for Difference in Mass.
The sample for last row is Plastic, with 7.2 Starting Mass, 7.1 Ending Mass and -0.1 for Difference in Mass.
After reading the group's procedure, describe what additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment.
Make sure to include at least three pieces of information.

[Key Elements]:
Needed Information:
You need to know how much vinegar was used in each container.
You need to know what type of vinegar was used in each container.
You need to know what materials to test.
You need to know what size/surface area of materials should be used.
You need to know how long each sample was rinsed in distilled water.
You need to know what drying method to use.
You need to know what size/type of container to use.
Other acceptable responses.

[Marking Rubric]:
3 points: The response describes three additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment;
2 points: The response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment;
1 point: The response describes one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment;
0 point: The response describes little or no accurate or relevant information from the acid rain investigation.
