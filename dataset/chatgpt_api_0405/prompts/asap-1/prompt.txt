[Question]: 
A group of students wrote the following procedure for their investigation.
Procedure:
1.Determine the mass of four different samples.
2.Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical, containers.
3.Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
4.After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
5.Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
6.Determine the mass of each sample.
The students's data are recorded in the table below.
A table contains four columns: Sample, Starting Mass (g), Ending Mass (g), Difference in Mass (g).
The sample for the first row is Marble, with 9.8 Starting Mass, 9.4 Ending Mass and -0.4 for Difference in Mass.
The sample for the second row is Limestone, with 10.4 Starting Mass, 9.1 Ending Mass and -1.3 for Difference in Mass.
The sample for the third row is Wood, with 11.2 Starting Mass, 11.2 Ending Mass and 0.0 for Difference in Mass.
The sample for last row is Plastic, with 7.2 Starting Mass, 7.1 Ending Mass and -0.1 for Difference in Mass.
After reading the group's procedure, describe what additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment.
Make sure to include at least three pieces of information.

[Key Elements]:
Needed Information:
You need to know how much vinegar was used in each container.
You need to know what type of vinegar was used in each container.
You need to know what materials to test.
You need to know what size/surface area of materials should be used.
You need to know how long each sample was rinsed in distilled water.
You need to know what drying method to use.
You need to know what size/type of container to use.
Other acceptable responses.

[Marking Rubric]:
3 points: The response describes three additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment;
2 points: The response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment;
1 point: The response describes one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment;
0 point: The response describes little or no accurate or relevant information from the acid rain investigation.

[Student Answer]: They would have to add a conclusion and a hypothesis to their procedure. In the data table they should have made observatiuons over the 24 hours period.
[Score and Rationale]: 0 points; This response describes no relevant piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment.

[Student Answer]: They should of use something different than vinegar, also it should been longer the 24 hours. Last of all, they should've used different samples.
[Score and Rationale]: 0 points; This response describes no relevant piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment.

[Student Answer]: In order to replicate this experiment you will need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You will need to know what to measure the mass with and you will also need to know why you are going to determine the mass of each of the four different samples.
[Score and Rationale]: 1 point; This response describes one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: “you will need to know how much vinegar to put into each container.”

[Student Answer]: The group would need to write in the experiment to measure the mass with the vinegar. They would also need to describe how much vinegar is needed in the containers. Lastly, you would want to know what the vinegar is suppose to do with the samples.
[Score and Rationale]: 1 point; This response describes one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: “describe how much vinegar is needed in the containers.”

[Student Answer]: After reducing the groups experiment, in order for me to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to say exactly how much vinegar the group put into each container. also do we have to cover the containers after we place the samples into the vinegar. Without this crucial information, the whole procedure would have different results than if we were to have the correct information to conduct the experiment.
[Score and Rationale]: 2 points; This response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: “how much vinegar the group put in each container” and “do we have to cover the containers after we place the samples into the vinegar.”

[Student Answer]: To replicate the experiment, the students should of said what the samples were, how much vinegar to use, and what the vinegar was support to do to the marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
[Score and Rationale]: 2 points; This response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: “what the samples were” and “how much vinegar to use.”

[Student Answer]: Well, First of all the chart wasn't there I wouldn't know what the 4 samples were. So they should have listed that. Also It says to put them in vinegar but it doesn't say how much vinegar should be put in. It also says to plave them in a container but it doesn't say what kind of container and how big. It also doesn't tell us the size of the samples.
[Score and Rationale]: 3 points; This response describes at least three additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: “...what the four samples were...how much vinegar should be put in...what kind of container...and the size of the samples.”

[Student Answer]: In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information such as, how much vinegar was poured into each container. Additionally, you would need to know how large the containers were and how much/ for how long the samples were rinsed with distilled water.
[Score and Rationale]: 3 points; This response describes three additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: “...how much vinegar was poured into each container...how large the containers were...and how long the samples were rinsed with distilled water.”
