[Question]: 
A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability.
Procedure:
1. Take a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length.
2. Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it is hanging freely down the side of the table.
3. Attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample.
4. Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.
5. Remove the weights and clamp, and measure the length of the plastic types.
6. Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
7. Perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1).
The student recorded the following data from the investigation.
The table shows the amount of stretch (in millimeters) for four different types of plastic, labeled as A, B, C, and D, when subjected to two different stretching forces, labeled as T1 and T2.
For plastic type A, it stretched 10mm under T1 and 12mm under T2.
For plastic type B, it stretched 22mm under T1 and 23mm under T2.
For plastic type C, it stretched 14mm under T1 and 13mm under T2.
Lastly, for plastic type D, it stretched 20mm under both T1 and T2.
a. Draw a conclusion based on the student’s data.
b. Describe two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results.

[Key Elements]:
Conclusions:
Plastic sample B has more stretchability than the other polymer plastics.
Plastic sample A has the least amount of stretchability compared to the other polymer plastics.
Not all polymer plastics have the same stretchability.
Different polymer plastics have different stretchability (and are therefore suited for different applications).
A reasonable conclusion cannot be drawn due to procedural errors.
Other reasonable conclusions 

Experimental Design Improvements:
Provide the before and after measurements for length (Did the samples all start out the same size?).
Make sure the samples are all of the same thickness.
Variations in thickness could have caused variations in stretchability.
Perform additional trials.
Some of the samples have similar stretchability (A and C, B and D).
Two trials may not be enough to conclusively state that one is more stretchable than the other.
Indicate how many weights were added to the clamps (Was it the same number for each sample?).
Other acceptable responses

[Marking Rubric]:
3 points: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results;
2 points: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. -or- The response describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student’s data;
1 point: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. -or- The response describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student's data.;
0 points: The response provides little or no correct information from the polymer investigation.
