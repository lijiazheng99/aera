1625,1,1,1,"1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen.","The student answer matches two possible correct responses: - You need to know what materials to test. - You need to know what size/type of container to use.  The answer does not describe accurate or relevant information for the vinegar quantity, the rinsing/drying period, or the type of vinegar used. Therefore, the student earns 1 point based on the following rule in the marking rubric: - The response describes one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment -- 1 point.",1
1630,1,3,3,"To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.","The student answer matches two possible correct responses: - You need to know what materials to test. - You need to know what size/type of container to use.

1642,1,1,1,"I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled.","The student answer partially matches the Possible Correct Responses, as they provide one relevant piece of information (size of samples) out of the three required. Therefore, the student score is 1 point out of 3 possible. The rule applied is ""The response describes one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment"". The student does not provide any information regarding vinegar, drying, container size, or other important variables, which are included in the Possible Correct Responses.",2
1650,1,0,0,"In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment.","The student answer matches none of the possible correct responses. Therefore, the student score is 0. The marking rubric is applied as follows: ""The response describes little or no accurate or relevant information from the acid rain investigation. -- 0 point.""",0
1655,1,2,2,"To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors.","The student answer matches two possible correct responses: ""You need to know how much vinegar was used in each container"" and ""You need to know what materials to test."" These responses are worth a total of 2 points. However, the student answer includes additional irrelevant information about drying the samples, which does not match any of the possible correct responses or contribute to replicating the experiment, so no additional points are given. Applying the Marking Rubric, the student score is 2 out of 3 points.",2
1658,1,3,3,To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.,"The [Student Answer] matches with these two [Possible Correct Responses]: - You need to know how much vinegar was used in each container. - You need to know what materials to test.  Based on the [Marking Rubric], the student describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment, so they are awarded 2 out of 3 points.",2
1659,1,3,3,The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.,"The [Student Answer] matches the following [Possible Correct Responses]: - You need to know how much vinegar was used in each container. - You need to know what size/type of container to use.  The response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment, which corresponds to the 2-point rule in the [Marking Rubric]. Since the response is accurate and relevant to the experiment, the student score is 2 points.",2
1661,1,3,3,"In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc).","The student answer matches three of the possible correct responses: knowing the amount of vinegar used in each container, knowing what materials to test, and knowing what size/surface area of materials should be used. Therefore, the student should receive 3 points according to the marking rubric.

1662,1,2,2,"Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment.","The student answer matches two of the possible correct responses: ""You need to know how much vinegar was used in each container"" and ""You need to know what materials to test."" The response does not match any of the other possible correct responses.

1668,1,3,3,"The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.","The student answer matches two possible correct responses: ""You need to know how much vinegar was used in each container"" and ""You need to know what materials to test."" However, the student answer only partially matches the correct response ""You need to know what size/surface area of materials should be used"" because it only mentions the size of materials, but not the surface area.   Based on the marking rubric, the answer deserves 2 points because it accurately describes two additional pieces of information needed to replicate the experiment. This matches the rule ""The response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment -- 2 points.""",2
1671,1,1,1,"We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p What kind of containers? ^p If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass.","The student answer matches two possible correct responses from the list: identifying the materials to test and questioning what type of containers to use. Additionally, the student mentions a potential issue related to the containers being dry, but this is not included in the list of possible correct responses.  According to the marking rubric, the response describes one additional piece of information, which earns the student 1 point. The rule applied is ""The response describes one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment -- 1 point."" While the student's response touches on two pieces of information, they are considered related and fall under the same category.  Therefore, the student earns 1 point for their answer.",2
