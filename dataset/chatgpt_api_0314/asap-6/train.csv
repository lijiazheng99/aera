If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.","[Key Elements]: 1.

Diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient, without the need for energy.  Facilitated diffusion lets objects too big to fit through the plasma membrane enter the cell through transport proteins without the need for energy.  Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens.","[Key Elements]: - Selective permeability is used by the cell membrane to allow certain substances to move across. - Passive transport occurs when substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. - Facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell. - Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, and/or a substance moves from an area of low to high concentration, or against the concentration gradient. - Protein channels or channel proteins allow for the movement of specific molecules or substances into or out of the cell.  [Marking Rubric]: - Three key elements -- 3 points - Two key elements -- 2 points - One key element -- 1 point - Other -- 0 points  The [Student Answer] includes aspects of the following [Key Elements]: - Selective permeability is used by the cell membrane to allow certain substances to move across. - Passive transport occurs when substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. - Facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell. - Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, and/or a substance moves from an area of low to high concentration, or against the concentration gradient.  Thus, the [Student Answer] matches four [Key Elements], earning 2 points according to the [Marking Rubric] (Two key elements -- 2 points). While the [Student Answer] includes some relevant information, it is not well developed nor accurate enough to fully earn credit for all the relevant [Key Elements]. Additionally, the answer includes some imprecise language and missing information that detracts from its clarity and accuracy.",2

[Reasoning]: The student's answer does not match any of the key elements provided in the question. Therefore, the student does not receive any points. The student's answer also does not provide any meaningful or accurate description of processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. As a result, none of the rules in the marking rubric can be applied to provide the student with any points.",0
