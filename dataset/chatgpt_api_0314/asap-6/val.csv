[Marking Rubric Rule Applied]: One key element - 1 point   [Reasoning]:  Although the answer mentions osmosis and passive and active transport, the descriptions are not entirely accurate, and only three key elements are identified.

Therefore, the student's answer matches three key elements, but the descriptions are not sufficient or accurate enough to score more than one point according to the marking rubric.",1
