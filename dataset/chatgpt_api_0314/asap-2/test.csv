4066,2,Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B has the largest amount stretched. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental decison is by allowing the weights to hang longer to see if the plastic would stretch more. Another way he could have improved his experiment is by doing a third trials to really be sure that his results are correct.,2,"  The student answer draws a valid conclusion from the data but only provides one improvement to the experimental design. Therefore, the student score is 2 points.   The student answer matches the second part of the Sample Response, which describes one improvement to the experimental design.

4067,2,A. Sample B plastic has the most stretchability. B. One way it to add the original length of the plastic to the chart so you can find the difference of the original and after it stretched. Another way is to show the weight of the weights being put on.,3,"  The student's answer partially matches the second part of the sample response, which describes two ways to improve the experimental design. Therefore, the student can receive 1 point for this section. However, the student's answer fails to draw a valid conclusion based on the data, as there is no mention of plastic type A having the least stretchability, and samples B and D having similar stretchability. Therefore, the response does not match any of the sample responses in the marking rubric. The rule that applies is ""The response describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student's data."" and the score is 1 point.",1
4068,2,The stretchiest plastic was plastic B in both trials. And the least stretchiest plastic was plastic A in both trials. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by adding a control and using the same length of each plastic.,2,"  The student's answer matches the second part of the Sample Response, which describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results. The student suggests adding a control and using the same length of each plastic. However, the student fails to draw a valid conclusion supported by the student's data.   According to the Marking Rubric, the student earns 1 point for accurately describing one way to improve the experimental design, but failing to draw a valid conclusion from the data.",1

The student have used the same length of plastic for every type and should have did more than one trial.,1,"  The student answer does not match the sample response provided as the conclusion they drew is different. However, the student correctly identified that the experiment could have been improved by using the same length of plastic for every type and doing more than one trial. Based on the marking rubric, the response describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student's data, which scores 1 point.",1
4070,2,a) Plastic type A and B stretched after being pulled apart for five minutes. Plastic type C and D either shrank in length or stayed the same.^p b) The student should of added a control by hanging the plastics with no weight. Also the student should specify how much weight is on the clamp.,1,"  The student's answer partially addresses the question, but it lacks clarity and does not fully answer the prompt. In terms of conclusions, the student mentions that plastics A and B stretched, while C and D did not. This is incorrect, given that all samples stretched, albeit to varying degrees. The student correctly notes that the plastic types have different levels of stretchability but does not draw an explicit conclusion.  In terms of experimental design improvements, the student mentions adding a control and specifying the weight on the clamp, which aligns with the first example in the rubric. However, since the student only provides one improvement, they cannot receive the full three marks available.  The student's response mostly matches the second example in the sample response, which earns 1 point. They attempted to describe one experimental design improvement but did not fully comprehend the range of possible improvements. Additionally, they did not correctly identify the differences in stretchability between the plastic types. Therefore, they should receive 1 point out of 3 possible points.",1

The [Marking Rubric] rule applied is ""The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the studentâs data and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results -- 3 points.""   Therefore, the student score is 3 points because their response both draws a valid conclusion and describes two ways to improve the experimental design.",3
4072,2,The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic B was the strongest. Plastic B was the strongest because in trial one it stretched the most to 22mm. Ther trial two B stretched to 23mm. To improve the experiment design the student could state a length they want the sample plastic to be. In the procedure the student should have stated labels that she/he was measuring in.,2,"  The [Student Answer] draws a conclusion that plastic B was the strongest, which matches with the second conclusion drawn in the [Sample Response]. However, the [Student Answer] only describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design by stating a length they want the sample plastic to be, whereas the [Sample Response] describes two potential improvements.   Based on this, the [Student Answer] receives a score of 2 points, as it draws a valid conclusion supported by the studentâs data and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. This fits the criteria of the second bullet point in the [Marking Rubric].",2
4073,2,"A conclusion that can be dawn from the students experiment is that plastic B is able to stretch the farthest (T1:22mm, T2:23mm) and plastic A stretched the least (T1:10mm, T2:12mm). The validity of this experiment could have been improved greatly by doing these two things; 1) Making sure that the starting length of the plastics were all the same and 2)determining how much of the plastic will be stretched to the table at the beginning. By doing these two things, you're ensuring controlled variables therefore validating your experiment",3,"  The [Student Answer] correctly draws a valid conclusion from the data, which is supported by the [Sample Response]. Both responses suggest that plastic B has the most stretchability while plastic A has the least. The [Student Answer] also provides two ways to improve the experimental design, which matches the description in the [Sample Response]. Therefore, the [Student Answer] matches the [Sample Response] that draws a valid conclusion and describes two ways to improve the experimental design, and the corresponding rule in the [Marking Rubric] is ""The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the studentâs data and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results -- 3 points."" Thus, the student earns three points.",3
4074,2,B. Two ways the students could improve the experiment is to doing it again and again until you get the same results. Another way could to leave the plastics hanging for longer.,1,"  The [Student Answer] is insufficient and does not provide a valid conclusion or two meaningful ways to improve the experimental design.

Therefore, the student score is 0 points, as per the last rule in the [Marking Rubric] which states that ""The response provides little or no correct information from the polymer investigation.""",0
4075,2,"I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable because according to the data plastic B in trial 1 stretched 22mm and trial 2 23mm unlike plastic type A which in T1 stretched 0mm and in trial 2 2mm. One way the students could have improved their experiment would be of saying exactly how much weights to add and keep it the same for all the plastics. Another way they could have improved this experiment would be by having the same length of plastic for all the plastics, also they could have done more trials to improve their experiment.",3,"  The student's answer matches the ""The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the studentâs data and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results"" sample response. The student correctly identifies plastic type B as the most stretchable and plastic type A as the least stretchable based on the data. They also suggest two ways to improve the experimental design, such as keeping the weight applied consistent across all the plastics and ensuring that all the plastics are the same length.   Based on this, the student earns 3 points according to the ""Marking Rubric"".",3
4076,2,"a. Based on the data, the strectchiest polymer plastic of the four is plastic type B, because in the both trials, it stretched the most (22 and 23 mm). ^p b. 1.)

Repeat the experiment with heavier weights to see if it affects the results.",2,"  The [Student Answer] matches the conclusion in the [Sample Response], which states that plastic type B is the stretchiest of the four and that plastic type A has the least amount of stretchability. The [Student Answer] provides two ways to improve the experimental design, which matches one of the options in the [Marking Rubric] for a score of 2 points.  Therefore, the student score is 2 points.",2
4077,2,a) The only type of plastic that appears to make no change with the 2 trials is plastic type D. ^p b) They could have improved their design/validity by telling us exactly how much they measured in procedure 1. Another would be they could do a 3rd trial.,1,"  The [Student Answer] partially matches the last reasonable conclusion in the [Sample Response], which states that a reasonable conclusion cannot be drawn due to procedural errors. However, the [Student Answer] fails to provide any valid conclusion supported by the data. For the experimental design improvements, the [Student Answer] describes one way of improving the experiment by conducting a third trial, which partially matches one of the valid improvements in the [Sample Response]. However, the [Student Answer] fails to mention the thickness of the plastics and the number of weights used in the procedure, which are two other valid improvements mentioned in the [Sample Response].   According to the [Marking Rubric], a response that draws a valid conclusion supported by the student's data and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results should be awarded 2 points. Since the [Student Answer] fails to draw any valid conclusion supported by the data, but partially describes one valid improvement, the response should be awarded 1 point.   Therefore, the [Student Answer] matches the third sample response in the [Marking Rubric], which describes one valid improvement, but fails to draw any valid conclusion.",2
4078,2,"a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable of all the plastic types. Type D was a close second. Plastic type A and C are not very stretchy. ^p b. To improve the validity of the experiment the student could have done 2 things, give the length of the plastics they used and give the amount/type of weights to weigh  the plastic down with the information, the experiment can be duplicated to get similar results.",3,"  The [Student Answer] matches the second part of the [Sample Response], which suggests two ways to improve the experimental design. However, it incorrectly states that giving the length of the plastics and the amount/type of weights would improve the validity of the experiment. The [Sample Response] suggests giving the before and after measurements for length and making sure the samples are of the same thickness. Therefore, the student answer partially meets the criteria for a score of 1 point.   According to the [Marking Rubric], a valid conclusion drawn from the student's data must be included to obtain a high score. The [Student Answer] correctly identifies Plastic type B as the most stretchable and Plastic types A and C as less stretchy. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 1 point for drawing a valid conclusion based on the student's data.   Overall, the student scores 2 points out of a possible 3 points according to the [Marking Rubric].",2
4079,2,Thus for our experimentation our data has proved in conclusion that plastic type B and D recivied similiar results as also high strechibility on their first trial. One way the students could have improved the data is by putting the tike in the data chart. Another way being how students could have improved their data is by telling the amount of weights added for stretching.,1,"  The student's answer matches the response that ""The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student's data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results"" from the [Marking Rubric].   The student concluded that plastic type B and D received similar results and had high stretchability on their first trial, which matches the valid conclusion drawn from the sample response. However, the student only mentioned two ways to improve the experiment - by including time in the data chart and specifying the amount of weights used, which is incorrect and only matches one of the two ways mentioned in the sample response.   Therefore, the student scores 1 point out of 3 according to the [Marking Rubric].",1
4080,2,a. Plastic Type B stretched the farthest in both trials. Type D stretched second farthest in each trial and C and A stretched the third and least farthest respectively. The order of each plastic type's stretchiness remained the same in both trials. ^p b. The student could have done more trials. They also could've used more specific types.,2,"  The student answer draws a valid conclusion from the data but only provides one improvement to the experimental design.

The rule in the marking rubric that is applied is ""The response provides little or no correct information from the polymer investigation.""",0
4082,2,a) Plastic D is the best type of plastic because it's the most stretchable unlike type A which is the least stretchable.^p b.) Do another trial and add heavier weights.,1,"  The student's answer matches the third sentence in the conclusion of the [Sample Response] by identifying that plastic D is the most stretchable and plastic A is the least stretchable. However, the student's answer fails to consider other conclusions that can be drawn from the data. Additionally, the student only provides one improvement for the experimental design and does not explain how this would improve the validity of the results.   According to the [Marking Rubric], the student's answer can only be awarded 1 point. The student failed to draw a reasonable conclusion supported by the data and provided only one improvement for the experimental design/validity of results. Therefore, the rule applied is: ""The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the studentâs data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results. -or- The response describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student's data.""",1

4084,2,"3. Based on the data, plastic D held the most weight. Plastic A held the least. Plastic C went down the second time, so maybe it wasnt sturdy enough. Two ways they could improve their experiment is to use different sized plastics. Instead of putting it attached to the table, it could be stretched over a cup. By doing this it will hold more weight, and they will get more acurate answers.",0,"  The student answer does not draw a valid conclusion supported by the data and only provides one way to improve the experiment. The answer incorrectly states that plastic D held the most weight, while the data shows that it had the same amount of stretching for both T1 and T2. The answer also makes an incorrect assumption about plastic C not being sturdy enough, which is not supported by the data. Additionally, the provided improvement only addresses the stretching force and not the other factors mentioned in the sample response.  Therefore, the student answer matches ""The response provides little or no correct information from the polymer investigation"" in the Marking Rubric, and the student score is 0 points.",0

In terms of the conclusion, the student correctly identified that plastic type A has the least amount of stretchability and that plastic type B has the most. However, the student incorrectly states the values as 10mm and 25mm, respectively, instead of 22mm and 23mm. Additionally, the student failed to mention plastic types C and D. Therefore, the student's response matches the ""The response provides little or no correct information from the polymer investigation."" rule from the Marking Rubric.   As a result, the student score is 0. The correct Sample Response that the student did not match is: ""Different polymer plastics have different stretchability (and are therefore suited for different applications). Plastic sample B has more stretchability than the other polymer plastics. Plastic sample A has the least amount of stretchability compared to the other polymer plastics. Not all polymer plastics have the same stretchability. A reasonable conclusion cannot be drawn due to procedural errors. Some of the samples have similar stretchability (A and C, B and D).

The response provides only one way to improve the experimental design, which is poorly worded and unclear. Additionally, there are grammatical errors and misspellings throughout the response, which indicates a lack of attention to detail.   Therefore, the [Student Answer] matches the response that ""The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the studentâs data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results"" from the [Marking Rubric].   As a result, the student score would be 1 point.",1

They do not draw a valid conclusion from the data as they state that all plastics are very close in the amount stretched when they are not, according to the data. The student suggests one improvement to the experimental design, which is to add a T3 trial, but their suggestion to keep the weights and clamps until the plastic breaks is not practical or safe.   The student answer matches ""The response describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student's data"" in the Marking Rubric.   The Sample Response that the Student Answer matches is: ""A reasonable conclusion cannot be drawn due to procedural errors.

They correctly provided one improvement for the experimental design (specifying the number of weights), but did not provide a second improvement.   However, their conclusion is not entirely accurate. While they correctly noted that plastic type D stretched the same amount under both trials, they did not accurately compare the stretchability of the different plastic types and did not draw any meaningful conclusions.   Based on the Marking Rubric, the student's answer would receive 1 point. This is because they provided one improvement for the experimental design, but did not draw accurate conclusions from the data.",1
4205,2,"a. Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b.

Therefore, the student earns one point for drawing a valid conclusion supported by the data. However, the student only provides one improvement to the experimental design, while the prompt asks for two. Nevertheless, the one suggestion is valid and relevant, addressing the need for indicating the weight added to the clamps and testing the length of the bag for a more extended period. Thus, the student earns one point for describing one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.  In summary, the student's final score is two points, which matches the ""The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the studentâs data and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results"" response rule in the Marking Rubric.",2

The first improvement mentioned in the student's answer is also present in the sample response. However, the student's conclusion is not as detailed as the sample response and only provides the name of the best plastic for stretchability.   According to the marking rubric, if the response draws a valid conclusion supported by the studentâs data and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results, the student will receive three points.

The student drew a valid conclusion based on the data, stating that Plastic B had the most stretchability and Plastic A and C had the least. They also suggested adding a third trial as a way to improve the experiment. However, they only provided one improvement and did not mention anything about the thickness or length uniformity of the samples, or the number of weights added. Therefore, they only meet one of the criteria described in the sample response, earning them 2 points according to the [Marking Rubric].",2

Additionally, while they provide two suggestions, only one relates to experimental improvements while the other focuses on creating a hypothesis, which is not relevant to the question.   Therefore, based on the Marking Rubric, the student's answer earns 1 point out of a possible 3 points.   The closest match in the sample response is ""A reasonable conclusion cannot be drawn due to procedural errors.""

For the experimental design improvements, the student suggests telling the differences between the two trials, which is not clear what they mean by that. They also suggest that the effect of different polymer plastics on their stretchability should be investigated, which is similar to the suggestion in the [Sample Response]. As a result, the student should receive 1 point for describing one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.   In summary, the student should receive a total score of 2 points, which matches the second criteria in the [Marking Rubric].",2
